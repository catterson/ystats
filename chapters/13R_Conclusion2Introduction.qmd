# Farewell! (A Conclusion)

Hi! In this final chapter, I'll summarize all the major themes from the course, integrate all of our critical statistics, R, and research methods skills into one transcendent ....

...oh, what's that? You are tired of reading and I am tired of writing and isn't a 13th chapter supposed to be unlucky anyway? [^13r_conclusion2introduction-1]

[^13r_conclusion2introduction-1]: And I only promised 12 chapters as part of the sabbatical project that gave me time and space to work on this textbook and I do not violate my contracts as an employee.

Okay then, I will plan to save all this transcendence for our last class at the end of the semester when everyone is feeling braindead and ready for THE HOPEFUL ROT of either summer or winter break.

Will be great to see you there.

Thanks!
