# Part 1 : Descriptive Statistics

We use statistics as a language to describe how individuals are both similar to, and different from, each other.

## Centrality

Statistics like the mean, median, and mode focus on what is most central to a distribution of data. These measures of centrality reduce the complexity of individual scores, but in doing so emphasize some of the core aspects of the variable. You can think of *centrality* like a summary of the data. While a lot of information is lost in summary (e.g., Lord of the Rings is much more about some Hobbits trying to destroy an evil ring), a summary often gets the key points across in few words (e.g., Lord of the Rings does spend a lot of time describing Hobbits trying to destroy an evil ring.)

### The Mean

#### Definition.

The mean (also known as the average) is one of the most important statistics, and the foundation for much of what we will do in this class.

You probably learned this equation as something like, “add up all the numbers and divide by the total number of numbers”. This is technically correct, but scientists like to be more specific and formal, and so statistics uses a more specific language.

The statistical equation for the mean is below; it may look confusing, but it is really just a fancy version of the same definition of the mean you know and love. Specifically, the formula defines the mean as “equal to the sum of all individual x-values (starting with the first individual and ending with the last individual in the dataset), and divided by the sample size.”

+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The Equation                                | Breakdown of Terminology                                                                                                        |
+=============================================+=================================================================================================================================+
| $$                                          | -   $\bar{y}$ = "y bar" = the mean of y                                                                                         |
| \Large \bar{y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n y_i}{n} | -   $\Sigma$ = Sigma = the "sum" of numbers (starting from the number on the bottom all the way through the number on the top). |
| $$                                          | -   $i$ = index = an individual                                                                                                 |
|                                             | -   $n$ = sample size = the number of individuals in the dataset                                                                |
|                                             | -   $y$ = a variable                                                                                                            |
+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

So, when reading this formula, you would "say" : "y bar (the mean) is equal to the sum of all individuals of y ($y_i$) starting with the first ($i=1$) and going all the way through the total number of individuals ($n$). And then you take that sum, and divide by the total number of individuals ($n$).

See?! Simple!

#### Why It Matters.

One important characteristic of the mean is that it is the value of a distribution that is closest to all the other scores. This means that the mean serves as our “best guess” (a prediction) about the value of what any random individual scores in this distribution. This is why the mean is also called the ‘expected value’.

You've internalized this in many ways - if you know the average temperature for summer in the Bay Area is a high of 70 degrees and a low of 56, then you can predict on any given day that you might need a sweater in the morning and evening, but will be hot in the afternoon.

HOWEVER - the mean does not perfectly describe all scores in the distribution (because people are complex - we are not the same). We’ll talk more about these “errors” in prediction when we talk about the standard deviation (a measure of complexity) below.

### The Median

#### The Definition

The **median** is the value that is in the very *middle* of a distribution of scores. This means that 50% of scores in the distribution are higher than the median value, and 50% of the scores are lower than the median value.  If there’s an odd set of numbers, the median is the middle number. If there’s an even set of numbers, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. 

So imagine two sets of numbers : what number is in the very middle?

-   2, 3, 3, 5, 10, 14, 19
-   2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 10, 14, 19

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Activity : What's the median?

-   2, 3, 3, 5, 10, 14, 19 = the median value is 5, since this number is in the middle. note that when calculating the median, the values of the data should be organized from smallest to larges.

-   2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 10, 14, 19 = the median value is 4; since there is no "true" middle, 4 is the value that is in the middle of the two nearest values 3 and 5.
:::

#### Why It Matters

Because the median is defined entirely by the middle of a distribution, it is less influenced by extreme data (outliers) than the mean. Below are two graphs of height. The one on the left is for a collection of people, and the histogram on the right is a graph of heights for a collection of people and some big friendly giants. The median of this distribution is illustrated as a vertical blue line, and the mean of this distribution is illustrated as a vertical red line.

### The Mode

#### The Definition

The **mode** is the most common number in a set of numbers. If two numbers are equally common in a distribution, then the distribution is said to be bi-modal (and more than two most common numbers = multimodal)

So if your distribution was : 2, 3, 3, 5, 10, 14, 19, 20, 20, then the mode would be…[^3r_description-1]

[^3r_description-1]: the mode would be 3 and 20, since these are the most frequent

#### Why It Matters

The mode is rarely reported in research articles - I sometimes see it in within-person studies, or in situations where researchers are measuring psychophysiological measures (like heart rate or vagal tone) where the peak of the distribution might indicate something important.

Conceptually, it can be interesting to note the presence of a mode, and to think about why a bi-modal (or multi-modal) distribution occurs. 

For example, look at the following illustration : why might this bimodal distribution occur?

![](images/3_bimodalwhy.png)

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
### Reasons for this bimodal distribution.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The more conventional answer is that this bimodal distribution represents overlap between male and females in a dataset. | Another possibility is that this graph illustrates a python who has swallowed an elephant.[^3r_description-2]\ |

## Complexity

Complexity refers to the ways that data differ from each other - really the focus of variation. And yet, as scientists, we are trying to understand patterns in that variation, and so have developed a language to talk about some of the systematic ways that individuals differ.

### Range.

#### Definition.

One way people differ is by the extreme ends; this is called **the range**. Most people refer to the range as the lowest and highest value; though sometimes the range is defined as the distance between the highest and lowest value.

#### Why It Matters.

The extreme low and high of your variable give you a sense about the limits of variation. How to interpret these limits really depends on the variable you are measuring; for a variable like reaction time in some cognitive task, I would expect the low end to be zero (or something near zero, but not negative) and the high end influenced by how long I would expect the task to take (usually anywhere from less than a second for a quick reaction to a few minutes.) If the high end of the range was something like 30-minutes, I would think that something went wrong.

As a researcher (and teacher) I often use the range as a quick way to ensure the data are correct - that is, to confirm that the lowest and highest scores are possible values given the way the variable was measured. For example, I check the range when looking at test scores to make sure no students got a negative score or score above 100% (both impossible in my class.)

### Outliers.

#### The Definition

Outliers are extreme values that are so different from the rest of the data that you remove them from the dataset because you worry that they might cause problems for your data. Outliers exist because of errors in data entry (for example, the person who lists their age as 1009 instead of 19) or because they represent individuals who are qualitatively different from the rest of your data (for example, the participant who is a billionaire and lists that as their income.[^3r_description-3])

[^3r_description-3]: No shame billionaires! You are just very different from the rest of us. Let us know if I can hang out on your yacht? You belong to an understudied group and I have some research ideas. kthxbye.

How extreme is too extreme? Some folks like to come up with rules for making this decision based on the number of standard deviations away from the mean or some other metric. I appreciate those efforts, but personally believe it’s better to judge outliers based on the qualitative decisions above (and use past research as a guide). Whatever you do, make sure to (1) justify your decisions, (2) report these decisions in your code and analyses, and (3) make any decisions about removing outliers as early as possible and before you start making predictions.

#### Why It Matters.

The presence of outliers in your data has the potential to influence your results in ways that will bias your results. For example, if someone wandered off in the middle of a cognitive task, their outliers for reaction time might make you think people took way longer to complete the task than people really needed to take. If I included everyone who didn't take the exam (and got a zero) in taking the average of the exam score, I might think that students did worse on the exam than they really did, when I should have excluded these zeros to get a better representation of how people did on the exam.

It's therefore super critical to a) identify any possible outliers in the data, and b) remove them from data analysis, and c) be 100% transparent that you have removed data. You will learn to do this using R in Part 4 below.

### Skew.

#### Definition.

Skew describes asymmetry in the shape of the distribution. A graph that is symmetrical has no skew.

![](images/3_skewgraphs.png){fig-align="center"}

It’s easy to confuse the different types of skew, so I like to think of skew as a type of pokemon (“pikaskew”), where the direction of skewness is defined by its tail, since Pokemon (at least the ones I can think of) have tails. This is my trick; feel free to use it (you are welcome) or develop your own! 

**skew → pikachu →** ![](images/3_pikaskew.png){width="102"}**--\> tail**

#### Why It Matters.

Skew can help us to think about why people

-   **Negative Skew (also called “Left Skew”)** is when the distribution “tail” sticks out on the negative (low) end of the measure. A negatively skewed distribution means that there’s a greater probability of high scores than low scores, and can be explained by ceiling effects (a measure does not differentiate between high scorers - like an exam that almost everybody aces because you were all prepared.)

-   **Positive Skew (also called "Right Skew")** is when the distribution “tail” sticks out on the positive (high) end of the measure. A positively skewed distribution means that there’s a greater probability of low scores than positive scores, and can be explained by floor effects (a measure does not differentiate between low scorers).

-   **No Skew (also called the "Normal Distribution")** is when the distribution is symmetrical.

### Kurtosis

Kurtosis describes the size of the tails, relative to the middle of the distribution. I think of kurtosis as the pointiness of the distribution. Mesokurtic is a distribution that looks “normal”, leptokurtic is a distribution that is skinny in the middle (with many individual scores in the tail of the distribution), and platykurtic is a distribution wide in the middle with few observations in the tails.

![](images/3_Kurtosis.png){fig-align="center"}

Like skew, there are ways to quantify kurtosis, but we won’t cover this in the class. I almost never see kurtosis reported as a statistic in journals.

## The Standard Deviation : A Mix of Centrality and Complexity

### The Definition

Standard Deviation (sd) is a way to quantify the ‘average’ variation in your dataset. More specifically, it is the average distance between all individual data points in the distribution, and the mean of the distribution. These distances (between an individual score and our prediction) are called residuals.

The standard deviation is always positive, since it describes the average distance of individual scores from the mean (residuals), and not whether those residuals are above or below the mean. A standard deviation of zero means there is no variation - all scores in the distribution are the same. The larger the standard deviation, the more variation there is in the data. There’s no limit to how large the standard deviation might be.

Understanding what the standard deviation is, and how it's calculated, is a critical skill. In the videos below I walk through how to calculate standard deviation by “hand”. You will never actually use this approach in real-life, but I find it very helpful to fully understand what a standard deviation is, and how (and why) we use residual scores in statistics. With the chickenweights dataset, of course.

#### Video : The Mean as Prediction

With no other knowledge about an individual, the mean is our best prediction about what an individual is like.

{{< video https://youtu.be/sK6_vcs23I0 >}}

#### Video : Residuals as Error

**Residuals** refer to the fact that the mean is not a perfect prediction for every person; people will differ from our predictions. These differences between each individual's actual score and our predicted value (in this case, the mean) are called residuals. The residuals will always be actual score minus prediction - I remember this because as researchers we care about actual people first.

{{< video https://youtu.be/AGl7jo3WRJY >}}

#### Video : The Sum of (Squared) Residual Errors

**The sum of squared errors (SS)** is a way to quantify the total residuals when using the mean to make predictions. As you'll see in the video, we must first square the residual differences in order to remove the direction (since we care about the total error, not whether the individual was above or below our prediction.). And then we sum these squared differences to quantify the total (squared error).

{{< video https://youtu.be/hN5opflzXIA >}}

#### Video : The (Unsquared) Average of These Squared Residuals = Standard Deviation

**The standard deviation** is the squared root of these averaged squared differences. Or, in less technical terms, the standard deviation is the average of how much people differ from the mean - a measure of the average variation.

{{< video https://youtu.be/4SQUK8GXwrI >}}

### Why This Matters

Great question! The standard deviation does two things :

1.  The standard deviation quantifies how much the "average" person differs from the average of the individuals in a group. This is a great statistic to have, since it quantifies how much individuals differ from each other on average (between-person variation)
2.  The standard deviation serves as a baseline for our predictions. The mean is a GREAT starting place for our predictions, but soon we will want to make more sophisticated predictions. We will do this with our good friend *the linear model*, and will know whether we can improve our predictions by decreasing the amount of residual error.

We will practice removing outliers in lecture! It will get easier.

# Part 3. Research for Fun and Profit

Researchers share their knowledge with others in **scientific articles**. These are written by researchers for other researchers, tend to be very detailed and technical, and are a researcher's golden ticket to getting a job, research grant, invited talk or book deal, podcast invitation, etc. So there’s a lot of pressure to publish research among academics.

## The Publication Process

Researchers spread their scientific knowledge by publishing research papers. You can read more about how researchers publish research HERE. However, the TLDR is something like this :

1.  **Researcher has an idea!** They assemble a team of others interested in the idea, and do a literature review in order to gain background knowledge on the topic.

2.  **Researcher designs a study, collects data, analyzes the data, and writes up the data as a report.** All the steps of the scientific method. This is what you will do for the final project!

3.  **Researcher submits the report to a scientific journal.** A journal is a collection of articles that are usually united by some common theme. In general, the shorter the name of the journal, the more prestigious[^3r_description-4]. For example, the “Journal of Research in Personality” is considered less prestigious than the “Journal of Personality and Social Psychology”, which is less prestigious than the journal called “Psychological Science”, which is considered less prestigious than the journal called “Science”. 

4.  **An editor decides whether to review or reject the article.** Editors make an initial decision - based on a summary of the study and a letter that the author writes to the editor - whether the research article might be a good fit for the journal. If so, they pass it along to the next step. If not, they send a “Thanks, but….” rejection letter.

5.  **The editor sends the article to peer-reviewers.** Peer reviewers are other researchers who have some related research interests or skills in the topic of the paper. They will look over the article. The editor may know these people, or they get asked by another peer-reviewer who didn’t want to do it but nominated someone else to step into the role. Peer-reviewers work on a completely voluntary basis - it’s seen as required service, and there’s a bit of professional reputation to maintain in doing this work. Yes, there are problems with unpaid labor in academia. We can chat about that if you’d like; ask questions / raise it as an issue on Discord.

6.  **The editor makes a decision on the paper based on the feedback from the peer-reviewers.** The editor summarizes the feedback, and either accepts the paper, accepts as long as the person makes necessary revisions, asks the researcher to “Revise and Resubmit” (this is called an R&R - probably the most common outcome, and does not guarantee that the paper will be accepted if the revisions are made, but will get sent out to peer-reviewers again), or rejects the paper. In any case, the author will see the comments made by the peer-reviewers and the editor.

7.  **The (accepted) paper goes to a proofreader and is published.** Hooray! This process probably takes anywhere from 6 months (insanely fast) to 2 years (or more, depending on the number of revisions that are required).

[^3r_description-4]: Prestige is a very subjective concept in science. However, scientists have found many ways to quantify it, as described in the sections below!

## Publish! Or Perish…?

Ask any grad student or professor - the publication process is stressful, unpredictable, slow, and threatening. Grad students are required to publish papers in order to have a chance at an academic job as a researcher (and even extremely productive and thoughtful graduate students are not guaranteed an academic job), professors are required to publish papers in order to get a chance of getting tenure (and even extremely productive and thoughtful researchers are not guaranteed tenure).

This creates incredible pressure on researchers to get results; pressure that often can interfere with people's ability to do GOOD science. We'll talk about this more throughout the semester; bring questions to class / Discord!

## Types of Research Articles

We’ll learn how to read and dissect scientific articles this semester, but first it will be important to learn how to identify There are a few different types of articles that researchers write :

1.  **Original Reports :** An original report is where the researcher(s) write about the results of a novel study they did to test some theory. This means the researchers did something “new” - usually they collected and analyzed new data to test a theory, or analyzed existing data in a new way. Here’s an example of an original report on the topic of emotion regulation.

2.  **Replication :** A replication is a type of study where a researcher repeats the steps they (or another) researcher did, and sees if they get the same result. As we discussed, psychology (and many other fields) is in a **replication crisis.** This type of article was not very common before the 2010s, but is more common now. Still, faculty tend to be biased toward producing original reports - a school like Berkeley or Stanford would not hire a researcher just for doing replications. Here’s an example of a replication on the topic of emotion regulation. Note this is not really a direct replication, since they replicated in a different population.

3.  **Meta-Analyses :** A meta-analysis is where researchers take other people’s data, collect it, and analyze it in order to see broad trends across an entire field. For example, a meta-analysis might take all the research on whether there’s a relationship between playing violent video games and violent behavior, and analyze this existing research in terms of common themes, such as the type of video games the researchers studied, the measures of violence, and the results. Meta-Analyses can be a great way to look at a broad trend, but they rely on the assumption that the individual studies they summarize are, in fact, valid themselves. That is, if there are systematic biases in the way researchers study a topic, the Meta Analysis won’t solve or even identify those problems. Here’s an example of a meta-analysis done on the topic of emotion regulation.

4.  **Review Article :** Review articles summarize existing research without doing any additional data analysis (in contrast to a Meta-Analysis, in which there is data analysis of past research). This is the closest thing to a paper you might write in an English class - the authors take past research, summarize it in terms of common themes, and maybe highlight limitations, or new directions the field might take. Review articles are a great way to get a broad overview of a topic, since they summarize and organize past research, and will often highlight next steps that researchers should take. Here’s an example of a review article done on the topic of emotion regulation.

## The Peer Review Process

In order to publish their results, researchers have their peers review their work, and provide comments or suggestions. The peer-review process ideally serves two purposes : 

1.  **Peer Reviewers Help Improve the Research.** The peers doing the reviewing are supposed to have expertise in the topic of the paper. This allows them to suggest ways to improve the paper. These suggestions can run from the simple (such as recommending other researchers to reference in the introduction or additional analyses to run) to very involved (suggestions for additional studies to run, different methods to use, or different people to study).

2.  **Peer Reviewers Provide a Vote of Confidence in the Ideas and Analyses of the Paper.** The editor of a journal will look to the peer reviewers for evidence that the research is “high quality” and / or novel enough to be published. There’s a fair amount of bias here - some reviewers think the research is good but not considered a “good fit” for the journal. But the “peer-reviewed” label of a journal gives at least one layer of confidence that some other people like this research.

One important aspect of the peer-review process is that the peer-reviewers are anonymous to the author, and sometimes the author is anonymous to the peer-reviewers. Ideally, this helps prevent previous beliefs bias (since some researchers may have positive or negative impressions of each other) and social influence bias (since a famous researcher at a fancy school may have their research more trusted than someone with less prestige to their name or institution). However, psychological fields are often small enough that people tend to know who’s doing what research, and there are other cues that can tip peer-reviewers off about who the author of a study is (for example, the author of a study will likely reference their own work, since their new study builds off their old study.)

| ![](images/angry_mickey.png) | You know how the music business can hurt artists and interrupt the free flow of groovy music??? Well, academic publishers are no different, and can make profits in the billions of dollars. They do this by charging exorbitant fees for accessing peer-reviewed articles, and not paying the researchers who publish papers any money. That’s right; researchers get a 0% commission of any sales of their academic articles. It is a horrible and corrupt system that deserves to die.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Finding Research Articles

Next week we will find research articles related to YOUR research interests. I like to use Google Scholar for this - I find the search features powerful and Google will comb the internet for free versions of research articles (so I don’t have to be on campus or have proxy access to UC Berkeley’s library or “steal” articles from publishers using sci-hub).

For example, searching for one of my dissertation chapters shows [this page](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=situational+suppression&btnG=).

![](images/5_DissChapterGoogle.png)\

### **How to Find Articles**

Some tips for finding an article related to your topic : 

1.  **Use the right “jargon”.** As part of the operationalization process, scientists use specialized terms. What you might call “holding it in” researchers call “expressive suppression”; a “jerk” would be someone “low in agreeableness”; that feeling of “being hella stressed before an exam but also low key stepping up because of that stress” is the “psychophysiological distinction between challenge and threat”. As you search for research related to your topic, take note of how researchers are describing related phenomena, and adjust your terms as needed. This is part of building your schema for the topic.

2.  **Look at past research on the topic.** If you’ve found a relevant article on your topic, it’s likely that the article has referenced other research that is also relevant. Read or scan through the introduction (or the references section) and see if there’s something that looks related to your interests.

3.  **Look at future research on the topic.** If you found a relevant article on your topic, it’s likely that other researchers have also read that article, and used it in their future research. Google Scholar has a “Cited By” button \[![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdWGVqSlFveQI-XwiVPiF5OVZfqTJ6ZVpbWoZ4d6eyX-vZsyT3FIds-nNl45tG3S27HzsIfnY5wTXOlGFuOUApLFAMv_gV26IYmMs8fK19bnTlcvPg3VyPAhpz2mM1si-r--9McWxuobdjof6KyiJ0TjZA_?key=1Qk4xdWCPgEH5SdUQ-Oz2w){width="40" height="13"}\]that you can use in order to see more recent articles that have referenced the article you found. This is a particularly useful way to find more recent research if you found a “classic” in the field, or check for replications or controversies.

4.  **Old Research is Okay! But look for new research too.** Many students wonder if an “old” study is still relevant. Some papers are “classics” in the field, and great to read. But it’s likely that our field’s understanding of self-esteem has changed from 1970. If you are hoping to build your schema on a topic, finding a review article from the last 10 years (or 5; or 2!) would be a good place to start.

### How to Evaluate an Article

It can often be overwhelming for students to sift through the masses of research on a topic and know what’s most important and relevant. 

Reading the article and using your critical thinking skills / psychological training is the best approach. To do this, it is recommended to **go to Graduate School,** where you canspend multiple years reading as much as you want on a beautiful college campus, taking classes where you can deeply engage with the research and ideas, immerse yourself in meaningful intellectual conversations had by other graduate students and kindly professors - the gleam of knowledge and excitement of supporting the next generation of researcher in their eye. Oh, that is not interesting to you / grad schools are flooded with applications / you can’t get an office hour appointment with your professor who actually / you don’t have the privilege of spending 5-8 years getting paid near-poverty wages to be a poor scholar? 

Well, below are a few other ideas to make superficial , all depending on our good friend social influence bias :

1.  **The Citation Count.** Google scholar allows you to see how many other research articles have referenced the article that you found. While this can be a nice way to see how influential a paper is, a paper could be referenced a lot for reasons other than its validity, and maybe no one has read the most amazing paper in the world.

2.  **The Impact Factor of the Journal.** Journals have different “prestige factors”, and the impact factor is one way to quantify this prestige. Impact factor is usually defined as the number of times the average article in a journal has been referenced by other researchers in a year. So an impact factor of 2 means that each article in that journal is referenced by two other articles in a year. The impact factor is something you have to look up - journals usually track this. I wouldn’t spend too much time worrying about it, but it’s a quick way to get a very superficial sense of the journal’s reputation. For example, let’s see how the impact factor relates to our rule of “broader journal name = more prestige”.

|  |  |
|----|----|
| **Journal** | **Impact Factor According to Google in 2024** |
| Journal of Research in Personality | 2.6 |
| Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | 6.4 |
| Psychological Science | 10.1 \[couldn’t find a recent stat on this tho\] |
| Science | 44.7 \[this escalated quickly\] |

3.  **The Researcher and Institution.** Another way to evaluate an article is by evaluating the author. Does it look like this research has produced other cool research, or do you find their work boring and problematic for some reason? Is this researcher well known and respected in the field? Do they seem to have a happy photo with all their graduate students on their lab website, or is their lab website 10 years old and just has one sad looking graduate student asking for help with their eyes? Has the researcher continued to produce interesting, reliable research? Or were they the subject of a replication scandal?

# TLDR.

We learned how to describe variables in terms of consistency (e.g., mean, median) and complexity (e.g., range, standard deviation). We focused on how to define the standard deviation, and then looked at how to do this in R.

Next week in lecture, we will continue to learn to use R, statistics, and our human brains to describe and understand how people differ.
