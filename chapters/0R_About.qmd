## This Book
This textbook will also be part of the **flipped classroom** approach that we will take this semester.

1.  **Before lecture** you'll read and watch some videos to be introduced to the content that we will then cover more deeply in lecture. You'll also take a short quiz (no time limit, open-note, and you can take as many times as you'd like) that will encourage you to do the readings, and let me know what topics are still confusing to students.
2.  **During lecture** we will review concepts that students still had questions about from the readings, and spend the rest of the time practicing and discussing the skills you learned. We will work on the homework assignment together
3.  **After lecture** you'll complete any homework that we didn't finish in class, and then read for the next week's lecture.

The flipped classroom approach requires y'all to do the readings and watch the videos before class.

The flipped classroom approach also requires me to write text and record videos that are engaging and helpful for the three main parts of this class.
