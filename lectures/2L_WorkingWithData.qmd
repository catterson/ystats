# Check-In, Agenda, and Announcements

Welcome Back! Access this Document Here :

[**PLEASE COMPLETE THIS CHECK-IN : tinyurl.com/againmodels**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRxOyLnGN7GO7ZQYziTuElo8k39b1feE915glmQMqI-1JBTA/viewform?usp=sf_link)

# PART 1 : No Statistics In This Class

## A Picture Is Worth 1000 Words

### Florence Nightingale :

1.  Did you learn about Florence Nightingale in other classes?
2.  What did you remember learning about Florence Nightingale in other classes?

### Discussion.

Look at the graph below, and use it to answer the following questions.

1.  **Ice Breaker :** What's the worst time you've been sick? What's your best way of trying to feel better / self-care when sick?
2.  **Look at the graph below :** What’s going on in this graph / who cares / how can we use this knowledge??
3.  **It's all linear models :** What are the variables in this graph? How would you organize these as a linear model?

### KEY IDEA : Visuals Matter

-   What is better about the way the barchart[^2l_workingwithdata-1] visualizes these data?

-   What is worse (or still confusing)?

## Learning from Histograms (No Statistics Terms!)

Below are some data that I graphed[^2l_workingwithdata-2]. Take 1-2 minutes and SILENTLY (on your own) think about what you learn about the variable from this graph. Avoid FANCY STATS LANGUAGE - just explain the main ideas without those labels for now.

[^2l_workingwithdata-2]: You will work with these later in the semester once we review how to create a likert scale (that combines 10 questions into one variable).

```{r}
#| include: false
d <- read.csv("../datasets/Self-Esteem Dataset/data.csv", stringsAsFactors = T, na.strings = "0", sep = "\t")
head(d)
names(d)
summary(as.factor(d$Q4))
SELFES.df <- data.frame(d[,c(1:2,4,6,7)], 5-d[,c(3,5,8:10)])
summary(SELFES.df)
library(psych)
alpha(SELFES.df)
d$SELFES <- rowMeans(SELFES.df, na.rm = T)
```

```{r}
hist(d$SELFES, col = 'black', bor = 'white', 
     main = "Histogram of Self-Esteem", 
     xlab = "Self-Esteem Score", breaks = 15)
```

# PART 2 : Working in R

## CODE BOOK : The Covid-19 Behavior Dataset

-   **Look over the codebook (below).**

    -   What is one variable from the dataset that is interesting to you (if any)?

    -   Is this categorical or numeric data?

    -   What predictions do you have about this variable?

    -   How might you use this variable in a linear model (as a DV or as a IV?)

-   **Loading Data Issues :**

    -   **rename this to something short!**

    -   **posit.cloud :** clicking on the name to load (vs. the “Import Dataset”)

## IN R : The Covid-19 Behavior Dataset

Things we will do.

-   Open up Lab 2

-   Create an RScript

-   Load the Covid-19 Behavior Dataset (.csv file) and the CODE BOOK (.pdf)

    -   the CODEBOOK explains what the variables measured

    -   the .csv data file contains the data.

    -   Make sure the data loaded correctly into R

-   Graph some variables and learn about the individuals from this graph

    -   numeric data

    -   categorical data

-   Save your work for Lab 2, Questions 1 and 2 and 3. Yeah!

# PART 3 : Defining Data

## Creating a Mini Class Dataset

-   Here's a list of the variables that y'all thought would be interesting to measure in the class (and I approved) from the check-in.
    -   List

    -   Goes

    -   Here
-   **DISCUSS :** which of these variables would be best measured with numbers (e.g., a scale from 0 to 10)? Which variables would best be measured with categories? (what would the factor and levels be?)
    -   Numeric Data Variables :
    -   Categorical Data :

## Operationalization, Construct, and Measurement Error

-   **operationalization** : how researchers define the variable(s) they will study; this is a process; often the focus of a researcher’s question in the scientific method.
-   **construct** : some operationalized psychological phenomenon of interest. some examples below :
    -   voxel : three dimensional area of brain activation
    -   self-esteem : how a person feels about themselves
    -   secure attachment style : how much a person seeks out and trusts a relationship partner.
-   **measurement error :** when there is a lack of validity in our measures. The more error in our measures, the more error there will be in our predictions (“garbage in → garbage out”).

**KEY IDEA :** the way a variable is measured is CRITICAL.

-   **The News Article :** What comes to mind when you think of a "Cognitive Test"?

## ACTIVITY : Counting Interruptions

[**Check-in :**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4GahfYtKFiSEFL5blw0lAG6jZepRzmnAewfUI9_iUf3dv9w/viewform?usp=sf_link)[**tinyurl.com/dudesinterrupting**](http://tinyurl.com/dudesinterrupting)

1.  Count the number of interruptions in the video (which professor will play below). 

2.  Submit your answer, **then wait for the letter of the day.**

![](lecture_images/1_interruption_oreilly&frank_operationalization.m4v)

**DISCUSSION TOPICS :**

-   How do we OPERATIONALIZE an INTERRUPTION?

-   What PREDICTIONS can we make about counting interruptions a second time?
