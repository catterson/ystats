# RECAP : Psychological Life is Variation

## Activity : Variables and Variation in the Room

**Class Activity.** Let's create a list of variables that we observe in this classroom.

-   

**Key Terms.** From the readings.

-   Affect, Behavior, Cognition

-   Between vs. Within-Person Variation

**\[7 Minutes\] Answer the following questions with your buddy.**

Find a buddy in the class! (There's a discord thread if you prefer to communicate with someone online.)

-   If you could have dinner with anyone in the world (living or dead) who would it be?

-   Why are you a psychology major? What interests you about people (or non-human animals)?

-   How would you label this interest as a variable?

    -   Are you interested in the between-person or within-person version of this variable?

    -   Are you interested in the Affective, Behavioral, or Cognitive aspect of this variable?

**Student Examples**

-   

# R : Defining Variables

## Thinking about Programming (Free Association Activity)

-   Close your eyes
-   Take a deep breath (inhale / exhale)
-   Visualize an image based on the word that you hear me say.
-   What do you observe?

## R is Your Friend

Let's open up RStudio and start working!

## In R : Variables and Variation

### Numeric Variables in R

|                                 | **\# =** what you store in the variable; each item should be separated by a comma and space.       |

### Example : Creating Numeric Variables

```{r}
counting <- c(1,2,3,4,5) # the numbers one through five
print(counting) # one way to "print" the variable
counting # another way to "print" the variable
hist(counting) # a way to graph the variable (a histogram)

### Example : Creating Non-Numeric Variables

The data below describe the categories of family laundry that was hanging in my apartment to dry.

```{r}
laundryhang <- c("shirt", "shirt", "leggings", "leggings", "shirt", 
             "shirt", "leggings", "pants", "sweater", "sweater") # defining a string variable
print(laundryhang)
laundryhang # another way to "print" the variable

laundryhang <- as.factor(laundryhang) # changing the format of the sting variable into a categorical factor
plot(laundryhang) # a way to graph the non-numeric variable
```

## Break Time: Meet Back at 3:25

## Prediction & Power

### Predictions in Real Life

-   Will it rain tonight?
    -   **Knowledge (what information did you use to make the prediction)?**
    -   **Power (ways your predictions influence future behaviors)**
-   Professor predicted that attendance would be HIGH today, but will dip later in the semester :(
    -   **Knowledge (what information did you use to make the prediction)?**
        -   first day of the semester; students are STOKED and MINIMALLY STRESSED.
        -   pattern seen in almost every past semester.
        -   Friday afternoons are basiscally the weekend.
    -   **Power (ways your predictions influence future behaviors)**
        -   prepared; made sure to arrive on time; tucked in shirt.
        -   remind students to attend with weekly announcements.
        -   create a positive classroom environment where students feel supported and like attendance is helpful.
        -   created an example that serves as meta-commentary on the importance of attendance.
    -   **Was Professor Valid?** TBD! \<3
-   **Work on Lab 1, Question 1. \[In Lecture\]** What’s a prediction about people that you made today? What information did you use to make this prediction? How did (or could) you use this prediction to influence outcomes? Were you valid in your predictions?

### Scientific Predictions

Psychological scientists seek to better understand variation, in order to help make valid predictions in ways that help exert power over our environments.

[^1l_whystats-1]: Here's [a link to the article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html) where this headline comes from. These data are a little dated, and I couldn't immediately find more recent data - my guess is Meta does not really want to advertise that people are using the product more and more. However, in [reports to investors](https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Earnings-Presentation-Q2-2024.pdf) reports consistent growth in metrics like "ad impressions" and "daily active users". Let me know if you find other sources to show how technology companies are capturing more and more of our attention!

## The Linear Model

### Definition

**Statistical Model :** DV \~ IV1 + IV2 + … + IVk + error

-   **DV = dependent variable** = the variable you want to predict

-   **IV = independent variable(s)** = the variable(s) you think will predict the DV

    -   k = any number = there can be MANY IVs

    -   **any variable can be an IV or DV - it’s up to the researcher to choose**

-   **\~ = a squiggly line / tilde =** our model is uncertain (not equal)

-   **error** = other factors that are not part of your model that would also explain the DV

-   **We say: “the DV is a function of…”; “the DV depends on the IV(s)”**

### Examples

-   rain \~

-   class quality \~

### Another Attendance Example

KEY IDEA : Models Help Make and Quantify Prediction

-   what information (IV) is related to the DV (predict)
-   which IV allows us to make the best predictions (effect size)
-   the amount of error in your prediction (error can come from our measures, our models, and maybe is just inherent to science?)

## Work on Lab 1 : Predictions & Research Questions.

**During our break, think a little bit about what research questions you might want to address for the project in this class. Below are some ideas to help you get started thinking of a research question if you are feeling stuck!**

-   Is there a real-world issue that you care about? What variables make up this questions?
-   What is something about people (your friends, parents, classmates) that you think is interesting or confusing? What variables are the focus of this interest or question?
-   What's a future career you might want to pursue with your psychology degree? What's a variable that is related to this career? What questions might you ask abut this variable?

**Question 2 \[In Lecture\] Get started on the final project by thinking through a research question you might be interested in studying as a psychology researcher. (Totally fine to change this, but great to start focusing on a question.)**

-   What is your question? Why do you care about this question (and / or why does this question matter to others)? How interested in this question are you on a scale from 0 (just doing to get credit for this question) to 10 (this is what motivates you to wake up each day and you will answer this question with the energy and passion of 1000 suns)?
-   How do your past experiences and background inform this question?
-   What is the variable that is the focus of this question? How does this variable relate to affect, behvaior, and cognition? Which aspect of this variable are you most interested in focusing on for your project?
-   What is the between-person form of variation for this variable? What is the within-person form of variation for this variable? Note: for the final project, I strongly recommend focusing on a between-person variation version of the variable for the final project.
