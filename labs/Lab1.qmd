# Lab 1

Spring 2025

**Create a Google Doc to answer these questions.** Please number your responses to help your GSI grade. There’s no word count, and we won’t penalize students for grammar or spelling. Do your best to explain your ideas in your own words, and if you get stuck or confused, post on Discord / ask your GSI / explain why you got stuck and what you tried to do to figure things out. 

1.  **\[In Lecture\]** What’s a prediction about people that you made today? What information did you use to make this prediction? Were you valid? How could you try to control outcomes based on your prediction?

2.  **\[In Lecture\]** Get started on the final project by thinking through a research question you might be interested in studying as a psychology researcher. (Totally fine to change this, but great to start focusing on a question.)

    1.  What is the variable that is the focus of this question?

    2.  Is this an example of between-person or within-person variation?

    3.  Are you interested in the affect, behavior, or cognitive component of this variable (or all three?) How do your past experiences and background inform this question?

    4.  How interested in this question are you on a scale from 0 (just doing to get credit for this question) to 10 (this is what motivates you to wake up each day and you will answer this question with the energy and passion of 1000 suns)?

3.  **\[In Lecture / Discussion Section / Chapter 2\]** Define two variables in R - one numeric and one string variable. Make sure to collect at least ten data points for each variable. Graph each variable, and include each graph in this lab assignment. Yeah!

4.  **\[In Discussion Section\]** With your discussion section,define each of the six biases described in the Goldacre (2010) reading on cognitive biases, and come up with an example from real-life.
