    "text": "Why Statistics in Psychology?\nAs y‚Äôall know, this class is a requirement for students who want to be psychology majors. This is exciting for me (your professor), and probably some students too. However, over the years I have learned this can be frustrating and stressful for students who wonder why-the-flip they are required to take a math class when all they just want to learn about people (or other non-human animals), ya know!??!\nI agree that people (or non-human animals) are interesting. And we all have this interest in people (or non-human animals) because we are complex1. While people are similar in many ways, we also differ in radical ways; from superficial features like age and race, to more complex ways like our personality or emotions, to highly specific behaviors such as whether all students in the class are reading these words or not, or how bored or excited (or any emotional experience) students are while reading these words.\nI hope that you have an interest in people (or non-human animals), and that this class helps you learn how to think about those interests through a psychological, and statistical lens. You don‚Äôt always need this lens - and as we will discuss there can sometimes be dangers in viewing people through this lens - but it‚Äôs useful to be able to wear these ‚Äúglasses‚Äù when needed.\n\nStatistics as a Language\nStatistics is a language that scientists use to describe this complexity. While psychology uses this language to better understand differences in people (or non-human animals), other scientific disciplines focus on their own domains; physicists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in matter and energy, chemists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in elements and compounds, botanists seek to understand differences in plants, and economists seek to understand money.\n\nVariables and Variation\nVariation is at the heart of statistics, and is defined by differences, change, and complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween-Person Variation describes how individuals differ from each other. Think about ways that you differ from others; not everybody wears glasses, has the same level of silliness / seriousness / desire to cause mischief / fascination with horses.\n\n\n\nWithin-Person Variation describes how one individual changes over time or across different situations. Think about the person you are today - are you exactly the same as you were yesterday? A year ago? You‚Äôve changed (varied) in ways both small (hunger, exhaustion, number of words you‚Äôve read for this class) and large (personality, love interests, identity, etc.)\n\n\n\nNo variation would describe a situation in which everyone is exactly the same. I can‚Äôt think of too many situations where there is no variation; let me know on Discord if you can think of one? And while there‚Äôs no theoretical limit to the amount of variation that there can be, one major task of this class will be to learn to quantify the amount of variation that we observe in our role as psychologists.\n\nüåûüåûüåû\nüåûüåûüåû\n\n\n\n\nA Variable is a label for some psychological phenomenon that has variation. I‚Äôm not sure where I first heard this, but psychologists often focus on what they call the ‚ÄúABCs‚Äù.¬†\n\nA is for Affect = the emotions that you feel.\nB is for Behavior = the actions that you do.\nC is for cognition = the thoughts you have.\n\nThese are not rigid categories, and psychologists often debate the definitions of these terms. But they can be useful ways to think about how to think about people, and help break down a complex phenomenon into more specific components.\n\n\nPractice : Variables and Variation\nFor example, think about how affect, behavior, and cognition might be relevant if I ask you to think about an upcoming exam (your first exam is in just a few weeks!)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhighlight the cells below to see my ideas / check your understanding\n\n\nAffect Example\nthe feeling of anxiety or dread you have thinking about being assessed, or maybe a feeling of excitement about the opportunity to demonstrate your hard work / effort / knowledge!\n\n\nBehavior Example\nimmediately checking your calendar to see when exams are; or maybe avoiding your classes with a nice procrastination session on the ol‚Äô infinite scroll machine.\n\n\nCognition Example\nthinking about all the work you have to do; wondering why the professor would choose this example when he could have thought about the ways that affect, behavior, and cognition would be triggered when you see a puppy or kitten or something like that‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n(Here‚Äôs a cat video I like for students needing a distraction from thinking about exams. I promise your exams in this class will be chill and I‚Äôll do my best to prepare y‚Äôall.)\n\n\nLanguage is More than Vocabulary\nStatistics is a language that scientists use to describe this complexity. While psychology uses this language to better understand variation in people (or non-human animals), other scientific disciplines focus on their own domains; physicists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in matter and energy, chemists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in elements and compounds, botanists seek to understand differences in plants, and economists seek to understand money.\n\nVocabulary. Equations like ‚Äúthe mean‚Äù or ‚Äústandard deviation‚Äù or ‚Äúcronbach‚Äôs alpha‚Äù or ‚Äúp-value‚Äù are precise vocabulary terms that define some feature of variation. Some of these vocabulary words are easier to understand and remember than others, and like all languages, sometimes people disagree on the definition, and sometimes misuse these words.\nGrammar and Syntax. The way we organize words also matters when learning languages. Saying ‚Äúthe professor graded the students‚Äú has a very different meaning than ‚Äúthe students graded the professor‚Äù, even though these share the exact same words. Statistics (and research methods) also requires precision in the way we organize the ideas, terms, and processes. We‚Äôll learn more about this as we discuss the scientific method (a highly structured and organized approach to doing research), but also as we learn how to navigate doing data analysis.\nCultural Immersion. A good language class will also help students to understand the ways that the language is connected to people, places, and history2. In this class, we‚Äôll think about the ways we can immerse ourselves in the culture of statistics and research methods, from the cultural practices that inform which methods or tools to use, to the ways that the culture of statistics and research might needlessly create barriers for certain types of people or studies.\nPractice and Past Experiences. And yes, in order to gain fluency in a language, you need to practice! Attendance and regular engagement with this class will ensure that you are able to get the practice that you need. It‚Äôs also good to note that people differ in terms of their past experiences with computers and math, and are bringing those experiences (for better or worse) with them into this class.\n\n\n\n\nCulture in Statistics : Me-Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHiya folks! Everyone‚Äôs favorite Open-Source Mickey Mouse here. I‚Äôll be popping up in the book from time to time to critically engage with the idea that statistics has a culture that is socially constructed by people like you!\n\n\n\nAll psychologists are interested in questions sparked by their own observations or experiences. This is sometimes called ‚Äúme-search‚Äù - the idea that a person‚Äôs research interests reflect their own experience.\nMe-search can be an important way for researchers to use their statistics and research methods training to address questions and issues that are relevant to their lives and communities.\nBelow are a few examples of research questions that are related to a person‚Äôs real-life experiences.\n\n\n\nReal Life Experience\nResearch Question\n\n\nA researcher develops vision problems due to his studies of light, and had to live in a completely darkened room, where he became completely isolated from most of reality.3\nDoes reality exist, or can it only be known through our perceptions?\n\n\nA black graduate student at the University of Chicago realizes that white people cross the street to avoid him, and finds himself whistling classical music to signal that he does not fit their negative stereotypes of a black male.4\nHow do people respond and react to others‚Äô negative stereotypes?\n\n\n\nHowever, me-search also serves as a form of potential bias in research - not only will a researcher‚Äôs own biases and beliefs influence the way they conduct research, but the types of questions that are asked will be influenced by the types of people doing research.\nFor example, a survey of over 26,000 research articles in psychology documented just how rarely the topic of race is studied in psychology (see figure below).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we‚Äôll discuss throughout this class, life is complex and there is never one explanation for any phenomenon. However, it‚Äôs important to note that psychology as a field has historically been dominated by white authors (researchers who write scientific papers) and white editors (researchers who decide what papers get published or not).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese trends are important to reflect on, because they reveal a bias in who becomes a psychologist, and what types of questions these researchers are interested in pursuing.\nIt‚Äôs also a goal of this class to not only highlight the important contributions of non-white researchers and statisticians, but also make sure that all students in this diverse classroom feels empowered to use statistics, research methods, and R skills to ask (and answer) research questions that matter to them!5",

R can be intimidating to work with at first, and is more confusing than it needs to be sometimes (as you‚Äôll quickly find out haha), but I promise you will learn! In fact, that‚Äôs the point of this class. It‚Äôs totally okay (and expected) for you to feel frustrated at times; this is part of the learning process. So please embrace the ‚ÄúI HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I‚ÄôM DOING‚Äù dog meme energy (and look how happy the doggy looks!) as you embark on your R journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling R\nUse this link to Download and Install the Programs R and RStudio Desktop\nNote : You must download both R and RStudio Desktop (these are two separate programs). Make sure to download the most recent version of R and RStudio to avoid issues in the future.\n\nR is the powerful, free, and somewhat intimidating computer program that we will use to analyze data in this class. This website is not super friendly - choose the operating system you have (Windows, MacOS, or Linux) and then download the ‚Äúlatest release‚Äù on the next page. If you have a chromebook or iPad / tablet, you will need to use posit.cloud.\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - basically a ‚Äúhome‚Äù for R to live in, with rooms and this program is not 100% necessary, but makes it a little easier to navigate R. Note that you will need to install R first in order for RStudio to work.\n\nHaving trouble getting these programs to work?\n\nHere‚Äôs one YouTube video someone made to show you how to download and install.\nTry posit.cloud. This is a web-based version of RStudio, and has a free option but limits you to 15-hours of work a month. There‚Äôs a paid option for $5/month that you can use; former students pointed out that you can always create a new ‚Äúfree‚Äù account if you run over the 15-hour limit.\nPost on our class Discord / go to section / office hours! The professor, other students, or your TA can help get everything working properly.\n\n\n\nNavigating R\nWatch the two videos below for a quick introduction to R - the program we will be using to analyze data.\n\nVIDEO : Navigating R\n\n\nwhat R looks like when you open it\nbasic math in the¬†console\nindexing and output\n\n\n\nVIDEO : Navigating RStudio\n\n\nwhat RStudio/Posit looks like; navigating the program\nbasic math in the console\nthe¬†source file¬†(makes life easier and saves your work!)",

    "text": "Psychology as a REAL SCIENCE ‚Ñ¢\nPsychology desperately wants to establish itself as a real science, like physics and chemistry. You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it, just look at the definitions of some common sources of psychological knowledge - introductory textbooks :¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúToday, we define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers, 2011)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the science of behavior and the mind.‚Äù (Grey, 2010)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the scientific study of mind, brain, and behavior.‚Äù (Gazzaniga, 2010)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶We now define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers & DeWall, 2018)\n\nI‚Äôm probably showing my age looking to textbooks, so let‚Äôs check in with ChatGPT6 to see whether the algorithmic summary of large piles of data suggests that psychology is, in fact, a ‚Äúreal science‚Äù :¬†\n\n\nPerhaps more authoritatively, the American Psychological Association (APA) confirms that psychology is, ‚Äúthe study of the mind and behavior‚Ä¶a diverse scientific discipline comprising several major branches of research.‚Äù (APA, 2024).¬†\nThe consistent emphasis on science (and ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù methods!) in these definitions is an attempt to elevate psychology to the status of other ‚Äúhard‚Äù sciences, like physics and chemistry. But inclusion of the term ‚Äúscience‚Äù also seeks to differentiate psychology from its less scientific heritage and past, defend itself from accusations from other scientists / talking heads (if not some of your friends in STEM majors‚Ä¶or parents) that it is not actually REAL SCIENCE ‚Ñ¢.¬†\n\nWhat is Science? Prediction (and Error)\nOne of the most important goals of science is to form predictions, and then use these predictions in order to influence outcomes (a form of power).\nA prediction is an educated guess you have about the future. Educated means that the guess comes from some knowledge (either your experiences, beliefs, something you learned in a textbook, or the results of a scientific study). A prediction can have two outcomes :\n\nValid : your prediction is right\nError : your prediction is wrong.\n\nOf course, things are rarely as simple as ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, and a large part of this class will be learning how to quantify exactly how much error there is in our scientific predictions.\nAs an example, let‚Äôs look to the stars.\n\n\n\n\nAstronomers have developed knowledge about celestial bodies - gravity, orbits, mass (I know very little about this).\nBut I trust this science because astronomers are able to use it to make very valid predictions about giant space rocks and when they will come close to the earth.7\nI can use this knowledge to plan a stargazing trip, or plan to watch all the rich people leave earth when the ‚Äúbig one‚Äù comes for the rest of us.\n\n\n\nFor our first lecture, start thinking of some predictions that you have made today. What knowledge informed the prediction. Did you use this prediction to influence your future behavior in some way? What kinds of predictions do psychologists make? We will chat more about these ideas in class :) but it‚Äôs a core focus on why psychologists use predictions.\nAnd so, here we are. In this document, in this required class for the psychology major, learning how to DO REAL SCIENCE. With statistics. So Oh yeah, and we‚Äôll also be learning to use this computer programming language called R üòà",

    "text": "Numeric variables\n\nDefinition : Numeric Variable\nNumeric variables are when the value of the variable is a number (e.g., your Extraversion score is 62 on a scale from 0 to 100; or you said ‚Äúum‚Äù fifty times yesterday, or scrolled your phone five times since starting this reading.¬†\nContinuous variables are a special type of numeric variable, with the idea that values of the variable represent an ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù range of possibilities.\nWe often simplify complexity into discrete groups, but for most complex phenomena, I believe that it‚Äôs best to think of life as a spectrum. For example, while I look at my walls and say ‚Äúthey are blue‚Äù, a physicist who really understands color theory would be able to interpret the wavelength of light that is being reflected off these walls, and understands that that wavelength really just a point on an infinite spectrum (bound by a certain range).\n\nPsychologists working in R often use numeric data, and see this as a list (or vector) of numbers. For example, below is data on the narcissism (variable = NPI; a measure of how self-absorbed; self-interested) of a group of Berkeley Haas MBA students were1.\n\nhaas &lt;- read.csv(\"./chapter_data/hormone_data.csv\", stringsAsFactors = T) \nhaas$NPI\n\n  [1] 3.43 4.40 3.13   NA 3.00   NA 3.05   NA   NA 3.63 3.95 3.08 3.83 3.23 3.80\n [16] 1.80 3.68 3.48 2.73 3.40 2.95 3.65 2.88 2.50 3.13 2.75 3.00 3.15 3.30 3.20\n [31] 2.43 3.13   NA 3.33 2.88 2.55 3.35 3.30 3.28 3.08 2.48 2.78 4.58 2.53 2.78\n [46] 2.88   NA 3.43 2.48 3.50 2.40 3.28 3.63 3.13 2.05 2.98 2.53 3.45 2.80 2.60\n [61] 2.05 2.60 2.73 3.25 2.78 2.93 3.08 3.33 4.05 3.65 3.15 3.33 3.98 4.48 3.00\n [76] 3.00 3.25 4.28 3.13 3.83 3.98 4.13 3.73 3.28 2.85 3.28 3.70 3.03 3.38 2.88\n [91] 3.20 3.40 3.70 3.50 2.58 2.90 3.00 3.35 2.63   NA   NA 4.05 3.43 4.28 3.00\n[106] 3.10 3.13 2.83 2.78 2.33 2.68 2.88 2.53 3.80 3.48 3.15 4.38 3.73 3.80 2.60\n[121] 3.38 3.13\n\n\nProfessor Interpretation I learn a lot just from this simple output!\n\nhaas &lt;- read.csv(‚Äú./chapter_data/hormone_data.csv‚Äù, stringsAsFactors = T‚Äù) is the R command that loads the dataset. Note that the path to the datafile - hormone_data.csv - is specific to the way I‚Äôve stored these data in my file system. You‚Äôll learn below how to change this to access your own dataset :)\nhaas$NPI is the R command that was used to generate the output below; a list of 122 individual Narcissism scores.\n\nI know there‚Äôs 122 individual scores because R is keeping count for me using indexing; the numbers in brackets. [1] shows that the first person in the dataset has a narcissism (NPI) score of 3.43; [118] 3.73 shows that this is the score for the 118th person in the dataset, and then I can count up to 122. There are much faster ways to do this, but I can do it this way too :)\nI also see there are a few missing data points in the responses - these are marked as NA. This could be people who didn‚Äôt complete the survey or were excluded for other reasons (e.g.¬†missing data).\n\n\n\n\nGraphing : The Histogram\nThe Histogram is a commonway researchers illustrate numeric variables. We will learn more about principles of good graphing this semester, but the KEY IDEA is to always always always graph your data because A PICTURE IS WORTH 1000 WORDS.¬†\nThe histogram organizes data - you lose the individual values, but gain understanding in seeing how data are grouped together, which helps you observe patterns and get a quick summary of the variable.¬†\nThere are two dimensions of a histogram :¬†\n\nthe x-axis (the horizontal axis; what goes across) : displays the values of the variable as organized into groups (or ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù, in R).¬†\nthe y-axis (the vertical axis; what goes up and down) : displays the frequency (or count) of the individuals in the data who ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to that group.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at our MBA friends again, through the power of a histogram. As you look at a graph, it‚Äôs important to practice thinking about what you learn from the data. Let‚Äôs avoid fancy stats terminology for now; it‚Äôs not necessary for our purposes!!\n\nhist(haas$NPI, xlab = \"Narcissism Score\", col = 'black', bor = 'white', main = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe code : this code draws a histogram using the hist() function. I‚Äôve also added several arguments that change some of the default settings to give the graph some digital style.\n\nxlab gives the x-axis of the graph a nice label.\ncolchanges the color of the bars to black.\nbor changes the color of the lines surrounding the bars to white.\nmain changes the title. In this case, \"\" sets the title to be nothing, so there‚Äôs no title.\n\nthe graph : okay, what did R do!\n\nx-axis : this reports the grouped values of the individual narcissism scores.¬†\ny-axis : this reports how many people were in each group.\n\nprofessor interpretation with no fancy stats language needed.\n\nmost people (around 42?) had a narcissism score between 3 and 3.5\na few people were really high in narcissism‚Ä¶above a 4.5. I‚Äôm not sure from the graph exactly how many people were in this group, or what their score was.\na few people were really low in narcissism‚Ä¶below a 2. Again, I‚Äôm not sure from the graph exactly how many people were in this group, or what their score was, but I see their humble selves!\nI also notice that this is not a super large study - the frequencies on the y-axis are relatively low numbers.\n\n\n\n\nActivity : Think about Data!\nOkay, your turn. Below is a graph from the same MBA students, but this time measuring their testosterone levels. Look over the graph, THINK about what you see, and then expand the textbox below (click on the arrow on the right side of the green box) to see what I wrote.\n\nhist(haas$test, \n     xlab = \"Testosterone Level\", main = \"\", \n     col = 'black', bor = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROFESSOR SPOILERS : Expand this textbox when you are ready by clicking on the arrow ‚Äî&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe graph\n\nx-axis : this reports the grouped values of the individual testosterone scores, measured in some kind of density (pg/ML)\ny-axis : this reports how many people were in each group.\n\nwhat I see and observe with no stats language :\n\nmost people (around 25+12+20 = 77) had a testosterone level between 50 and 100.\nthere were no scores below zero (which makes sense) and one person who had a very high level of testosterone. I‚Äôm not a hormone researcher, but the non-negative values seems good, and I might want to make sure that there wasn‚Äôt some data entry error for the extreme score.\nAgain, I notice that this is not a super large study‚Ä¶.and these relatively low numbers seem similar to the narcissism data, which makes sense since they came from the same study.",

    "text": "Categorical Factor Variable\n\nDefinition : Categorical Factor Variable\nA categorical factor variable is when the values of the variable represent different groups, usually labeled with some kind of word. Categories are often useful and simple ways to group individuals together. For example, when I see a color, I don‚Äôt ever describe it in terms of its color hex code or specific wavelength - I just call it by the simple primary color that I got from the crayola box; maybe the 24 color version if I‚Äôm feeling fancy.\nWhich of the shades below would you call blue?2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe broad label for the variable is called the factor, and the specific groups of data are called levels. So in the color example, the category of color would be the factor, and the different groups of color would be the levels.\nAs another example, researchers can measure gender with categories such as female, male, transgender, and other. Identify the factor and levels in this example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the factors and levels in the example above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor : would be the variable of gender. Generally there‚Äôs one factor label for each variable.\nLevel : would be the categories female, male, transgender, and other.\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture in Statistics : Gender Identity\n\n\n\n\nHi folks! It‚Äôs me again, Open-Source Mickey Mouse to talk with you about the idea that statistics has a culture that is socially constructed by people like you! We live in a society where people in positions of power often have very narrow definitions of what it means to be a person! This manifests in all sorts of ways - you probably feel this pressure when you think about what it means to be a ‚Äúsuccessful student‚Äù.\nOne domain where this is particularly relevant is in the area of gender identity. While many people identify as ‚Äúmale‚Äù or ‚Äúfemale‚Äù, some people don‚Äôt fit into these categories. (Seems pretty simple to me to let folks exist as they want! But I‚Äôm just a poor public servant.) Yet as folks in power have recently forced this narrow binary view of gender identity onto everyone, it becomes even more critical to engage with these ideas and try to define a science that can capture the complexity of human life in ways that let people be their full selves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, most psychological researchers still hold on to Male / Female binaries in the way they measure gender or sex, yet there are many reasons - both scientific and humanistic - to give people more range to express important aspects of their identity3.\nIndeed, categories almost always oversimplify the complexity of life, yet are often used by people (and researchers) because they can sometimes be useful and simple shortcuts for us to understand the world.\nIf you are simply interested in doing a superficial survey of a variable like race, ethnicity, or gender, then I think categorical data can be a fine -if often unscientific - approach, and would recommend giving all people the chance to express their identity in some way.\nHowever, if you are interested in really digging into a variable, then a continuous approach is almost always best. We‚Äôll discuss more on how to do this in a few weeks when we learn about continuous variables and likert scales.\n\n4\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphing : The Categorical Plot\nThe histogram only describes a graph for numeric data, since it organizes numbers into groups (it kind of turns complex variation into more simple categories). When the variable is categorical, people call it a plot ü§∑.\nThis graph looks very similar to our histogram :¬†\n\nthe x-axis (the horizontal axis; what goes across) : displays the levels of the factor variable.\nthe y-axis (the vertical axis; what goes up and down) : displays the frequency (or count) of the individuals in the data who ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to each group.\n\nAlright, back to our good MBA friends. This is a graph of the categorical variable ‚Äúsex‚Äù. Again, look over the graph, THINK about what you see (no stats terminology; what do you learn!), and then highlight my text to see what I wrote about.\n\nplot(haas$sex, col = 'black', bor = 'white', xlab = \"Sex\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Code : this code draws a histogram using the plot() function. Note that I‚Äôve asked R to plot the variable haas$sex. I‚Äôve also added several arguments that change some of the default settings to give the graph some digital style.\n\nxlab gives the x-axis of the graph a nice label.\ncolchanges the color of the bars to black.\nbor changes the color of the lines surrounding the bars to white.\n\nThe Graph :\n\nx-axis : this reports levels (female; male) of the categorical factor variable Sex.¬†\ny-axis : this reports how many people were in each group.\n\nWhat I see and observe with no stats language :\n\nIt appears that the researchers only measured sex as a f/m binary (or that no participants reported a category other than female or male).\nthere were more males than females in this dataset. This matches my perception / stereotype of what a typical MBA program might look like; however I looked into it and Haas reports a larger percentage of female enrollments in the MBA program; so our data may not serve as a representative sample of the true population.6",

    "text": "Part 2 : Working with Datasets\n\nThe Dataframe\n\nDefinition : Rows and Columns\nAs a researcher, you‚Äôll be interested in understanding not only one variable at a time, but will be interested in a dataset - multiple variables about an individual that are organized - in order to see how variables are related to each other (remember : this is a function of the linear model).\nThe datasets in our class will be stored on Dropbox; you can find a link to this on bCourses (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll learn how to load these datasets later in this lecture. For now, what is a dataset?\nA dataset is really a dataframe - a two-dimensional way to organize data - and takes the following structure in this class.\n\nthe rows define the individual in the dataset.¬†rows go across horizontally, like a rowboat going across a lake.\nthe columns define the variables in the dataset. ¬†go up and down vertically; like what might support a bridge.\n\nLook at the example below - again from our budding MBAs in the Haas program. What do you observe about the rows and columns? What does this tell you about the dataset?\n\n\nIn the example dataframe above - I see 5 rows (representing 5 individuals) and five columns (representing five variables like the person‚Äôs age, their sex, their testosterone levels, political ideology, and their NPI (Narcissism) score.¬† or their Race, etc.) Note that the names of the variables do not count as a row, since these are not individuals in the dataset, and you would need to know more about the dataset to know that ideo = political ideology, or test = testosterone. I also see that R is helpfully telling me that this is only a snapshot of the entire dataset - the whole dataframe has 122 entries (rows), meaning that there‚Äôs 122 MBA students in this dataset, and 5 total columns (which we can all see here.)\nAs a researcher, you have access to an entire dataset (either collected by you or another researcher) that organizes multiple variables for each individual. This semester, we‚Äôll work with a variety of datasets on different psychological topics - not just haas students.\n\n\nDefinition : Indexing\nThe dataset gives us access to all the individual rows and columns at once, we will often want to focus on one specific variable (or individual) at a time. Indexing refers to a flexible method of selecting a specific set of data from a larger collection. Previously‚Äô we‚Äôve seen indexing when asking R to produce a large set of numbers; for example asking it to count from 1 to 100.\n\n1:100\n\n  [1]   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18\n [19]  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36\n [37]  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54\n [55]  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72\n [73]  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90\n [91]  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100\n\n\nThe indexing shows up as brackets next to the actual data, and is way for R to index that the [1]st data entry is the number 1, the [24]th entry is the number 24, and so on.\nWhen I ask R to show me the dataset haas, the output can be overwhelming. Below is what R shows you when you ask to see the haas dataset. And this is a relatively small dataset with just 122 individuals (rows) and five variables (columns).\n\nhaas\n\n    age    sex   test ideo  NPI\n1    NA   male     NA   NA 3.43\n2    NA   male 143.89   NA 4.40\n3    NA   male     NA   NA 3.13\n4    30   male     NA    4   NA\n5    28   male     NA    4 3.00\n6    33 female     NA    5   NA\n7    NA   male     NA   NA 3.05\n8    NA   male     NA   NA   NA\n9    NA   male  77.95   NA   NA\n10   NA   male     NA   NA 3.63\n11   26   male 126.29    3 3.95\n12   31   male  59.48    5 3.08\n13   27   male  89.45    4 3.83\n14   27   male  82.80    3 3.23\n15   28   male  97.39    4 3.80\n16   30   male  54.80    4 1.80\n17   28   male  46.07    4 3.68\n18   24   male     NA    4 3.48\n19   32   male  87.40    3 2.73\n20   25   male  85.01    4 3.40\n21   27   male     NA    3 2.95\n22   25   male     NA    4 3.65\n23   24   male 102.86    3 2.88\n24   28   male  73.60    3 2.50\n25   27   male     NA    2 3.13\n26   29   male  90.68    4 2.75\n27   28   male  44.70    3 3.00\n28   29   male     NA    4 3.15\n29   30   male  77.61    4 3.30\n30   26   male  57.20    5 3.20\n31   31   male  49.92    4 2.43\n32   28   male     NA    3 3.13\n33   32   male     NA    5   NA\n34   27   male  85.01    2 3.33\n35   32   male  74.86    2 2.88\n36   27   male 125.89    3 2.55\n37   29   male  77.07    4 3.35\n38   30   male     NA    4 3.30\n39   26   male  30.54    4 3.28\n40   27   male  73.76    3 3.08\n41   32   male  65.61    3 2.48\n42   29   male  51.23    4 2.78\n43   28   male  85.17    3 4.58\n44   28   male     NA    3 2.53\n45   29   male  57.14    2 2.78\n46   30   male  65.31    4 2.88\n47   28   male  53.07    4   NA\n48   28   male 104.65    3 3.43\n49   31   male  90.32    3 2.48\n50   NA female  24.71   NA 3.50\n51   26 female  20.99    3 2.40\n52   27 female     NA    4 3.28\n53   28 female     NA    3 3.63\n54   28 female   5.51    5 3.13\n55   27 female  40.49    4 2.05\n56   25 female  35.05    2 2.98\n57   26 female  57.71    4 2.53\n58   26 female  27.36    4 3.45\n59   27 female  59.37    3 2.80\n60   26 female  21.63    3 2.60\n61   29 female     NA    3 2.05\n62   25 female     NA    7 2.60\n63   37 female  39.50    4 2.73\n64   28 female  42.35    4 3.25\n65   24 female  32.42    3 2.78\n66   29   male  97.63    4 2.93\n67   28   male 131.51    3 3.08\n68   26   male     NA    4 3.33\n69   27   male     NA    5 4.05\n70   29   male     NA    2 3.65\n71   27   male 140.53    2 3.15\n72   26   male     NA    3 3.33\n73   28   male     NA    3 3.98\n74   22   male  90.88    5 4.48\n75   29   male 148.24    5 3.00\n76   29   male 132.24    4 3.00\n77   27   male  82.43    4 3.25\n78   26   male  73.43    4 4.28\n79   35   male     NA    2 3.13\n80   27   male 100.49    4 3.83\n81   25   male  94.31    4 3.98\n82   27   male  72.53    2 4.13\n83   30   male 133.35    4 3.73\n84   27   male  59.77    4 3.28\n85   30   male  91.83    4 2.85\n86   29   male  82.13    3 3.28\n87   30   male 172.15    3 3.70\n88   29   male 228.17    2 3.03\n89   27   male 133.70    3 3.38\n90   27   male  89.24    4 2.88\n91   28   male  88.62    3 3.20\n92   28   male  86.83    4 3.40\n93   25   male 138.65    4 3.70\n94   33   male  59.75    4 3.50\n95   28   male  46.30    3 2.58\n96   31   male 107.02    3 2.90\n97   24   male  60.16    2 3.00\n98   26   male     NA    4 3.35\n99   27   male 107.71    3 2.63\n100  23   male  99.64    2   NA\n101  32   male 131.51    3   NA\n102  29   male  91.94    4 4.05\n103  25   male  53.67    3 3.43\n104  25   male     NA    4 4.28\n105  27 female     NA    4 3.00\n106  27 female  59.24    2 3.10\n107  30 female  28.03    5 3.13\n108  28 female  33.38    5 2.83\n109  26 female  53.31    4 2.78\n110  28 female  27.53    4 2.33\n111  29 female  16.89    4 2.68\n112  25 female  51.53    4 2.88\n113  26 female  37.15    4 2.53\n114  27 female  50.55    2 3.80\n115  28 female     NA    4 3.48\n116  28 female  41.35    5 3.15\n117  29 female  64.66    5 4.38\n118  24 female  37.95    2 3.73\n119  27 female  54.26    4 3.80\n120  27 female     NA    4 2.60\n121  27 female 113.41    4 3.38\n122  29 female  41.35    3 3.13\n\n\nI am overwhelmed with data.

    "text": "The .csv File\n\nDefinition : The .csv File\nAs a researcher, you will work with data that you (or other researcher friends) have collected. The .csv file (csv stands for comma separated variables) is one of the most common formats for storing data that you will encounter. You‚Äôve probably encountered this before, and likely have opened this file type in a program like excel or google sheets. But in this class, we‚Äôll learn to load these files directly into R. Using R has two advantages :\n\nR is way more powerful than excel or Google Sheets.\nR allows us to document all of our steps. This semester, we‚Äôll learn how to make changes to the dataset (e.g., changing the names of a variable; removing bad data; transforming data). It‚Äôs important to be completely transparent about these changes, and doing these changes in R (with an R Script!) will ensure that we document our steps for our future selves / other researchers.\n\n\n\nVideos : How to Load Datasets in R\nThere are two different ways to load a data file into R : one way (‚Äúthe point and click method‚Äù) involves clicking some boxes, like most of y‚Äôall are used to doing. The second way involves typing in an R command. Below are videos that highlight each method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRegardless of which method you use, there are three things you want to check every time you load data : change the name of the dataset (to make it something simple to type and memorable); check the headers (make sure the variables have names, since sometimes), and set stringAsFactors = TRUE (which will automatically convert all your string variables into categorical factor variables, which is almost always what you will want to do in this class.\nThese instructions are highlighted because students often forget. So note the importance! They are important steps!!!\n\n\n\nVideo : Importing Data with the ‚ÄúPoint and Click‚Äù Method and Console Method\n\n\nthe ‚Äúpoint and click‚Äù method of loading data\nthe console / Rscript method of loading data\n\n\n\nVideo : For Posit Users : working with projects and loading data in the cloud.\n{{&lt; video https://youtu.be/HOhINtpyjT4&gt; }}\n\nposit.cloud users!

    "text": "The Dataframe\n\nDefinition : Rows and Columns\nAs a researcher, you‚Äôll be interested in understanding not only one variable at a time, but will be interested in a dataset - multiple variables about an individual that are organized - in order to see how variables are related to each other (remember : this is a function of the linear model).\nThe datasets in our class will be stored on Dropbox; you can find a link to this on bCourses (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll learn how to load these datasets later in this lecture. For now, what is a dataset?\nA dataset is really a dataframe - a two-dimensional way to organize data - and takes the following structure in this class.\n\nthe rows define the individual in the dataset.¬†rows go across horizontally, like a rowboat going across a lake.\nthe columns define the variables in the dataset. ¬†go up and down vertically; like what might support a bridge.\n\nLook at the example below - again from our budding MBAs in the Haas program. What do you observe about the rows and columns? What does this tell you about the dataset?\n\n\nIn the example dataframe above - I see 5 rows (representing 5 individuals) and five columns (representing five variables like the person‚Äôs age, their sex, their testosterone levels, political ideology, and their NPI (Narcissism) score.¬† or their Race, etc.) Note that the names of the variables do not count as a row, since these are not individuals in the dataset, and you would need to know more about the dataset to know that ideo = political ideology, or test = testosterone. I also see that R is helpfully telling me that this is only a snapshot of the entire dataset - the whole dataframe has 122 entries (rows), meaning that there‚Äôs 122 MBA students in this dataset, and 5 total columns (which we can all see here.)\nAs a researcher, you have access to an entire dataset (either collected by you or another researcher) that organizes multiple variables for each individual. This semester, we‚Äôll work with a variety of datasets on different psychological topics - not just haas students.\n\n\nDefinition : Indexing\nThe dataset gives us access to all the individual rows and columns at once, we will often want to focus on one specific variable (or individual) at a time. Indexing refers to a flexible method of selecting a specific set of data from a larger collection. Previously‚Äô we‚Äôve seen indexing when asking R to produce a large set of numbers; for example asking it to count from 1 to 100.\n\n1:100\n\n  [1]   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18\n [19]  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36\n [37]  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54\n [55]  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72\n [73]  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90\n [91]  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100\n\n\nThe indexing shows up as brackets next to the actual data, and is way for R to index that the [1]st data entry is the number 1, the [24]th entry is the number 24, and so on.\nWhen I ask R to show me the dataset haas, the output can be overwhelming. Below is what R shows you when you ask to see the haas dataset. And this is a relatively small dataset with just 122 individuals (rows) and five variables (columns).\n\nhaas\n\n    age    sex   test ideo  NPI\n1    NA   male     NA   NA 3.43\n2    NA   male 143.89   NA 4.40\n3    NA   male     NA   NA 3.13\n4    30   male     NA    4   NA\n5    28   male     NA    4 3.00\n6    33 female     NA    5   NA\n7    NA   male     NA   NA 3.05\n8    NA   male     NA   NA   NA\n9    NA   male  77.95   NA   NA\n10   NA   male     NA   NA 3.63\n11   26   male 126.29    3 3.95\n12   31   male  59.48    5 3.08\n13   27   male  89.45    4 3.83\n14   27   male  82.80    3 3.23\n15   28   male  97.39    4 3.80\n16   30   male  54.80    4 1.80\n17   28   male  46.07    4 3.68\n18   24   male     NA    4 3.48\n19   32   male  87.40    3 2.73\n20   25   male  85.01    4 3.40\n21   27   male     NA    3 2.95\n22   25   male     NA    4 3.65\n23   24   male 102.86    3 2.88\n24   28   male  73.60    3 2.50\n25   27   male     NA    2 3.13\n26   29   male  90.68    4 2.75\n27   28   male  44.70    3 3.00\n28   29   male     NA    4 3.15\n29   30   male  77.61    4 3.30\n30   26   male  57.20    5 3.20\n31   31   male  49.92    4 2.43\n32   28   male     NA    3 3.13\n33   32   male     NA    5   NA\n34   27   male  85.01    2 3.33\n35   32   male  74.86    2 2.88\n36   27   male 125.89    3 2.55\n37   29   male  77.07    4 3.35\n38   30   male     NA    4 3.30\n39   26   male  30.54    4 3.28\n40   27   male  73.76    3 3.08\n41   32   male  65.61    3 2.48\n42   29   male  51.23    4 2.78\n43   28   male  85.17    3 4.58\n44   28   male     NA    3 2.53\n45   29   male  57.14    2 2.78\n46   30   male  65.31    4 2.88\n47   28   male  53.07    4   NA\n48   28   male 104.65    3 3.43\n49   31   male  90.32    3 2.48\n50   NA female  24.71   NA 3.50\n51   26 female  20.99    3 2.40\n52   27 female     NA    4 3.28\n53   28 female     NA    3 3.63\n54   28 female   5.51    5 3.13\n55   27 female  40.49    4 2.05\n56   25 female  35.05    2 2.98\n57   26 female  57.71    4 2.53\n58   26 female  27.36    4 3.45\n59   27 female  59.37    3 2.80\n60   26 female  21.63    3 2.60\n61   29 female     NA    3 2.05\n62   25 female     NA    7 2.60\n63   37 female  39.50    4 2.73\n64   28 female  42.35    4 3.25\n65   24 female  32.42    3 2.78\n66   29   male  97.63    4 2.93\n67   28   male 131.51    3 3.08\n68   26   male     NA    4 3.33\n69   27   male     NA    5 4.05\n70   29   male     NA    2 3.65\n71   27   male 140.53    2 3.15\n72   26   male     NA    3 3.33\n73   28   male     NA    3 3.98\n74   22   male  90.88    5 4.48\n75   29   male 148.24    5 3.00\n76   29   male 132.24    4 3.00\n77   27   male  82.43    4 3.25\n78   26   male  73.43    4 4.28\n79   35   male     NA    2 3.13\n80   27   male 100.49    4 3.83\n81   25   male  94.31    4 3.98\n82   27   male  72.53    2 4.13\n83   30   male 133.35    4 3.73\n84   27   male  59.77    4 3.28\n85   30   male  91.83    4 2.85\n86   29   male  82.13    3 3.28\n87   30   male 172.15    3 3.70\n88   29   male 228.17    2 3.03\n89   27   male 133.70    3 3.38\n90   27   male  89.24    4 2.88\n91   28   male  88.62    3 3.20\n92   28   male  86.83    4 3.40\n93   25   male 138.65    4 3.70\n94   33   male  59.75    4 3.50\n95   28   male  46.30    3 2.58\n96   31   male 107.02    3 2.90\n97   24   male  60.16    2 3.00\n98   26   male     NA    4 3.35\n99   27   male 107.71    3 2.63\n100  23   male  99.64    2   NA\n101  32   male 131.51    3   NA\n102  29   male  91.94    4 4.05\n103  25   male  53.67    3 3.43\n104  25   male     NA    4 4.28\n105  27 female     NA    4 3.00\n106  27 female  59.24    2 3.10\n107  30 female  28.03    5 3.13\n108  28 female  33.38    5 2.83\n109  26 female  53.31    4 2.78\n110  28 female  27.53    4 2.33\n111  29 female  16.89    4 2.68\n112  25 female  51.53    4 2.88\n113  26 female  37.15    4 2.53\n114  27 female  50.55    2 3.80\n115  28 female     NA    4 3.48\n116  28 female  41.35    5 3.15\n117  29 female  64.66    5 4.38\n118  24 female  37.95    2 3.73\n119  27 female  54.26    4 3.80\n120  27 female     NA    4 2.60\n121  27 female 113.41    4 3.38\n122  29 female  41.35    3 3.13\n\n\nI am overwhelmed with data.

Note that there are tabs here for Plots (where graphs will pop up), Packages (things you can download to give R extra features), a Help viewer (sometimes very useful!).\n\n\n\n\n16.2.4 ACTIVTY : open up RStudio\n\nType some math into an Rscript, and send it to the console. Yeah, you are programming!\nDefine two variables in R - one numeric and one string variable (these can be unrelated to your project topic!) Make sure to collect at least ten data points for each variable, and show that you successfully defined the variable in R by ‚Äúprinting‚Äù it in R.

Below are some ideas to help you get started thinking of a research question if you are feeling stuck!\n\nIs there a real-world issue that you care about? What variables make up this questions?\nWhat is something about people (your friends, parents, classmates) that you think is interesting or confusing? What variables are the focus of this interest or question?\nWhat‚Äôs a future career you might want to pursue with your psychology degree? What‚Äôs a variable that is related to this career? What questions might you ask abut this variable?\n\nQuestion 3 (In Lecture / On Your Own). Get started on the final project by thinking through a research question you might be interested in studying as a psychology researcher. (Totally fine to change this, but great to start focusing on a question.)\n\nWhat is your question? Why do you care about this question (and / or why does this question matter to others)? How interested in this question are you on a scale from 0 (just doing to get credit for this question) to 10 (this is what motivates you to wake up each day and you will answer this question with the energy and passion of 1000 suns)?\nHow do your past experiences and background inform this question?\nWhat is the variable that is the focus of this question? How does this variable relate to affect, behavior, and cognition? Which aspect of this variable are you most interested in focusing on for your project?\nWhat is the between-person form of variation for this variable? What is the within-person form of variation for this variable? Note: for the final project, I strongly recommend focusing on a between-person variation version of the variable for the final project.\nDo you have ideas about what might predict or explain this variable (the answer to your question)? How would you write this out as a linear model?\n\n\n\n16.7.2 Student Examples",

You can think of centrality like a summary - while a lot of information is lost in summary (e.g., Lord of the Rings is much more about some Hobbits trying to destroy an evil ring), a summary often gets the point across in few words (e.g., Lord of the Rings does spend a lot of time describing Hobbits trying to destroy an evil ring.)",

This means that the mean serves as our ‚Äúbest guess‚Äù (a prediction) about the value of what any random individual scores in this distribution. This is why the mean is also called the ‚Äòexpected value‚Äô.\nYou‚Äôve internalized this in many ways - if you know the average temperature for summer in the Bay Area is a high of 70 degrees and a low of 56, then you can predict on any given day that you might need a sweater in the morning and evening, but will be hot in the afternoon.\nHOWEVER - the mean does not perfectly describe all scores in the distribution (because people are complex - we are not the same).

Most people refer to the range as the lowest and highest value; though sometimes the range is defined as the distance between the highest and lowest value.\n\n\nWhy It Matters.\nThe extreme low and high of your variable give you a sense about the limits of variation. How to interpret these limits really depends on the variable you are measuring; for a variable like reaction time in some cognitive task, I would expect the low end to be zero (or something near zero, but not negative) and the high end influenced by how long I would expect the task to take (usually anywhere from less than a second for a quick reaction to a few minutes.) If the high end of the range was something like 30-minutes, I would think that something went wrong.\nAs a researcher (and teacher) I often use the range as a quick way to ensure the data are correct - that is, to confirm that the lowest and highest scores are possible values given the way the variable was measured. For example, I check the range when looking at test scores to make sure no students got a negative score or score above 100% (both impossible in my class.)",

    "text": "Outliers.\n\nThe Definition\nOutliers are extreme values that are so different from the rest of the data that you remove them from the dataset because you worry that they might cause problems for your data. Outliers exist because of errors in data entry (for example, the person who lists their age as 1009 instead of 19) or because they represent individuals who are qualitatively different from the rest of your data (for example, the participant who is a billionaire and lists that as their income.3)\nHow extreme is too extreme? Some folks like to come up with rules for making this decision based on the number of standard deviations away from the mean or some other metric. I appreciate those efforts, but personally believe it‚Äôs better to judge outliers based on the qualitative decisions above (and use past research as a guide). Whatever you do, make sure to (1) justify your decisions, (2) report these decisions in your code and analyses, and (3) make any decisions about removing outliers as early as possible and before you start making predictions.\n\n\nWhy It Matters.\nThe presence of outliers in your data has the potential to influence your results in ways that will bias your results. For example, if someone wandered off in the middle of a cognitive task, their outliers for reaction time might make you think people took way longer to complete the task than people really needed to take. If I included everyone who didn‚Äôt take the exam (and got a zero) in taking the average of the exam score, I might think that students did worse on the exam than they really did, when I should have excluded these zeros to get a better representation of how people did on the exam.\nIt‚Äôs therefore super critical to a) identify any possible outliers in the data, and b) remove them from data analysis, and c) be 100% transparent that you have removed data.

    "text": "The Standard Deviation.\n\nThe Definition\nStandard Deviation (sd) is a way to quantify the ‚Äòaverage‚Äô variation in your dataset. More specifically, it is the average distance between all individual data points in the distribution, and the mean of the distribution. These distances (between an individual score and our prediction) are called residuals.\nThe standard deviation is always positive, since it describes the average distance of individual scores from the mean (residuals), and not whether those residuals are above or below the mean. A standard deviation of zero means there is no variation - all scores in the distribution are the same. The larger the standard deviation, the more variation there is in the data. There‚Äôs no limit to how large the standard deviation might be.\nUnderstanding what the standard deviation is, and how it‚Äôs calculated, is a critical skill. In the videos below I walk through how to calculate standard deviation by ‚Äúhand‚Äù. You will never actually use this approach in real-life, but I find it very helpful to fully understand what a standard deviation is, and how (and why) we use residual scores in statistics. With the chickenweights dataset, of course.\n\nVideo : The Mean as Prediction\nWith no other knowledge about an individual, the mean is our best prediction about what an individual is like.\n\n\n\nVideo : Residuals as Error\nResiduals refer to the fact that the mean is not a perfect prediction for every person; people will differ from our predictions. These differences between each individual‚Äôs actual score and our predicted value (in this case, the mean) are called residuals. The residuals will always be actual score minus prediction - I remember this because as researchers we care about actual people first.\n\n\n\nVideo : The Sum of (Squared) Residual Errors\nThe sum of squared errors (SS) is a way to quantify the total residuals when using the mean to make predictions. As you‚Äôll see in the video, we must first square the residual differences in order to remove the direction (since we care about the total error, not whether the individual was above or below our prediction.). And then we sum these squared differences to quantify the total (squared error).\n\n\n\nVideo : The (Unsquared) Average of These Squared Residuals = Standard Deviation\nThe standard deviation is the squared root of these averaged squared differences. Or, in less technical terms, the standard deviation is the average of how much people differ from the mean - a measure of the average variation.\n\n\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nGreat question! The standard deviation does two things :\n\nThe standard deviation quantifies how much the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù person differs from the average of the individuals in a group. This is a great statistic to have, since it quantifies how much individuals differ from each other on average (between-person variation)\nThe standard deviation serves as a baseline for our predictions. The mean is a GREAT starting place for our predictions, but soon we will want to make more sophisticated predictions. We will do this with our good friend the linear model, and will know whether we can improve our predictions by decreasing the amount of residual error.",

    "text": "Definition.\nThe ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù (or Gaussian) distribution is a common shape for what distributions of data look like. The shape is often called a ‚Äúbell curve‚Äù, because it looks like the curve of a bell.\nWhile many distributions appear normal, the ‚ÄúNormal Distribution‚Äù ‚Ñ¢ refers to a distribution that describes an expected probability of a range of scores.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Normal Distribution is called ‚Äúnormal‚Äù because researchers expect to see this type of distribution for variables where two conditions are met:\n\nThere are multiple explanations for why the variation occurs. This happens very frequently across all science, since life is complex and there are many reasons why individuals differ.\nThese multiple explanations occur randomly. This means that the multiple explanations for variation are mostly independent of one another, and there is not some shared experience among individuals that is influencing their variation.\n\n\nExample : Thinking About Distributions\nFor example, let‚Äôs look at one example ‚Äúnormal‚Äù distributions - the ‚Äúself-esteem‚Äù variable we saw in Lecture 2. Note that it‚Äôs not perfectly normal4, but it‚Äôs pretty close and representative of the kind of ‚Äúreal world‚Äù data that you might encounter.\n\nhist(d$SELFES, col = 'black', bor = 'white', \n     main = \"Histogram of Self-Esteem\", \n     xlab = \"Self-Esteem Score\", breaks = 15)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúRandom‚Äù explanations for why variation in self-esteem occurs. Self-esteem is complex, and can be influenced by variables such as: genetics, parental environment, home environment, income, neurotransmitters, whether your crush told you they like you too the day you took the self-esteem survey, etc. These variables are considered random because one does not influence the other, and they differ across participants in the study. That is, someone who had a happy parental environment may not necessarily have a high income.¬†\n‚ÄúNon-Random‚Äù Explanations. Careful observers will note that self-esteem appears slightly shifted above the mid-point of the scale (which goes from 1-4, so 2.5 would be the mid-point), and that there‚Äôs some slight negative skew (meaning more individuals are on the higher end of the distribution). This shift is likely the result of some shared cultural experiences among participants - our society values self-esteem, and people might be biased to self-enhance / self-present a higher self-esteem. This is a non-random influence, since many participants might experience this.\n\n\nExample 2 : Thinking About Distributions\nBelow is another example of a distribution - this one is not random, but is skewed (pop quiz : is it positively or negatively skewed? See here for answer5.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúRandom‚Äù Reasons for Variation\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of things can influence a student‚Äôs score on an exam, such as how much students were motivated to study, how much time they had to study, what was going on in their lives, whether they had a study buddy in the class, whether they were sick or not on the day of the exam, their ‚Äútest taking‚Äù skills and strategies and anxiety levels, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚ÄúNon-Random‚Äù Reasons for Variation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data are not normally distributed because the students were all part of the same college, in the same classroom, taught by the same professor, at the same time. The professor did his best to prepare these students, and wrote a test that would be based on the kinds of practice they had gone over in lecture. These variables are considered ‚Äúnon random‚Äù because they were shared by all students. The data are skewed because these non-random shared experiences helped students do well on the exam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture in Statistics : The Normal Curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat‚Äôs right folks, it‚Äôs time for another chat with your friend Open-Source Mickey Mouse! This time, we‚Äôre gonna chat about the idea that people differ from some average. The idea that you could quantify people as ‚Äúaverage‚Äù is fairly new - it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint exactly, but a scientist named Quetelet first extended the statistical methods derived from astronomy to be applied to humans in the 1860s6. Quetelet thought the average was an ideal state since it reflected the center of all possible individuals. However, a few years later Francis Galton used Quetelet‚Äôs ideas to try and ‚Äúrank‚Äù individuals according to some hierarchy of excellence. For Galton, the average was not an ideal state, but rather something to overcome in a desire for greater and greater excellence. Galton was also a racist and father of the eugenics movement, who used distorted statistics as a tool to justify his own pre-existing racist beliefs that white people were superior to everyone else.\n\n\n\nBut you don‚Äôt have to take it from me! Here‚Äôs Galton in his own words :\nTo conclude, the range of mental power between‚ÄîI will not say the highest Caucasian and the lowest savage‚Äîbut between the greatest and least of English intellects, is enormous. ‚Ä¶ I propose in this chapter to range men according to their natural abilities, putting them into classes separated by equal degrees of merit, and to show the relative number of individuals included in the several classes‚Ä¶..The method I shall employ for discovering all this, is an application of the very curious theoretical law of ‚Äúdeviation from an average.‚Äù First, I will explain the law, and then I will show that the production of natural intellectual gifts comes justly within its scope. - Galton, Hereditary Genius (1869). Linked here.\n\n\nThe point of bringing up some of the racist origins of statistics is two-fold :\n\nMany people like to argue that ‚Äúgood‚Äù statistics is objective, and that scientists are free of bias. So it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that the inventors of many statistics that we use had clear biases and did not behave objectively. Rather than try to be free of bias, I think it‚Äôs important to acknowledge where and when people are biased, and address those biases up explicitly.\nStatistics is a tool, and that tool can be used poorly and dangerously in ways that can cause a lot of pain. Just because something has numbers doens‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs correct. For example, Galton‚Äôs work showing ‚Äústatistically‚Äù that white people were superior in ability to other groups didn‚Äôt account for other factors like socioeconomic status. And for what it‚Äôs worth, modern scientists overwhelmingly agree that ‚Äúrace‚Äù is a social construct. There are genetic differences that explain different skin tones, however there is more genetic variation in skin tone within a similar ‚Äúrace‚Äù than between different ‚Äúraces‚Äù. Read more about this here.\n\nAlright, that‚Äôs all for now! Let me know what you think and see you next time!",

Unlike physical variables like temperature or mass, psychological variables are often internal to people, and defined by mental states that are difficult to observe. As we saw in lecture, even a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù expressed behavior like an interruption can be very difficult to measure with high degrees of reliability and validity that we would hope. For a more complex variable such as depression, the task might seem impossible. Indeed, a large part of psychological research is engaging in debate and scholarship about how to best operationalize variables of interest (e.g., how should we define or measure depression?)\nA full discussion of the different types of methods psychologists use to collect data is beyond the scope of this author. However, below I‚Äôve tried to outline a few different approaches psychologists take, commenting on their benefits and limitations so you can begin to critically think about whether these methods are, in fact, getting at ‚ÄúTHE TRUTH‚Äù of what people (or non-human animals) are like.",

    "section": "Self-Reports",
    "text": "Self-Reports\nOne of the simplest ways to collect data on an individual is just to ask them what they are like, and have the person report on themselves (a self-report). There are two different approaches to getting self-reports - survey methods and qualitative interviews.\n\nQualitative Interviews\nOne way to get individuals to tell you what they are like is through a structured interview where researchers ask open-ended questions. One such example of this is the McAdams Life Narrative1. In this structured interview, a trained research assistant asks a set of broad questions to participants over the course of 1 to 3 hours. The research assistant is advised to ‚Äúfeel free to skip some of these questions if they seem redundant or irrelevant, and should follow up with other questions as needed ‚Äú but also to ‚Äúnot adopt an advisory or judgmental role, but should instead serve as an empathic and encouraging guide and an affirming sounding board.‚Äù\nBelow is an excerpt from the first part of the interview - if you are comfortable, please share your chapters on the Chapter 4 Discord thread!2\n\n\n\n\nSurvey Methods\nQualitative interviews are not very common in psychological research, because they take a lot of time to conduct, and then more time to convert people‚Äôs open-ended responses into data (a form of behavioral coding, described in more detail below).\nInstead, the majority of self-reports come from surveys. Read about these below.\n\n\n\nDefinition\nA questionnaire where individuals answer specific questions about themselves on a structured rating scale.\n\n\nExample\n‚ÄúOn a scale from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree), how satisfied with your life are you right now?‚Äù\n\n\nBenefits\n\nEasy to collect : It only takes a few minutes for people to answer a survey, and the data come in a clean and organized format that requires little effort to analyze. In Part 2 below, you‚Äôll learn how to clean and organize the results of a likert scale.\nSelf-Knowledge Validity : People know things about themselves, often this knowledge is based in ‚Äúreality‚Äù, and sometimes a self-report is the only way to get this knowledge. For example, only you know what was your happiest moment in life, and you probably have an accurate awareness about how anxious you are about the final project in this class.\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nSelf-Enhancement / Self-Diminishment Bias : People are often motivated to either enhance or diminish their accomplishments when asked. For example, no student has ever come up to me at the end of the semester and told me, ‚ÄúProfessor, just so you know - I cheated on the exam.‚Äù Even though they may know they cheated, they don‚Äôt want to admit that because our society has norms or guidelines about when cheating is appropriate3. Other times, a person may not want to highlight their accomplishments (self-diminishment) because they don‚Äôt want to seem like they are bragging.\nSelf-Insight Bias : Sometimes, people also really don‚Äôt know what they are like. A person may not know, for example, whether they snore when they sleep (a behavior), how anxious they really are in a situation (an affect), or their patterns of unconscious bias (a cognition).\n\n\n\n\nSelf-reports have a bad reputation in psychology, particularly because of the ability for people to engage in self-enhancement/diminishment or self-insight bias. However, they are a very powerful, and very commonly used method of assessment, even for studies where researchers are able to observe other types of data.¬†\nFor example, despite all the behavioral data that powerful technology companies like Facebook/Instagram/Meta, TikTok, Twitter/X, etc. collect, you‚Äôve probably seen them ask you to answer some survey. They care about you4, and know that asking you questions about yourself is an important way to show that level of care.\nBelow is one example from some survey when I used to be on Facebook. If they changed their graphic design since I was last on, it‚Äôs probably because of some survey feedback they received.",

    "text": "Observations\nOften, self-reports are insufficient to capture what a person is like, or researchers are studying individuals who cannot give self-reports, such as infants, people with disabilities, or non-human animals.5\nRead about some common forms of observation methods below.\n\n\n\nDefinition\nObservational methods refer to ways in which another individual generates data on the target person of interest.\n\n\nExamples\nInformant Reports. Informant reports are a special form of surveys, where researchers ask friends, family, or strangers to answer survey questions about another person. This is technically observational data, since the people answering the surveys are basing their judgments on their observations of the individual.\n |\nBehavioral Data. When the variables of interest are physical, then researchers can use measurement tools to directly observe the behavior. For example, researchers wanting to measure stress might measure cortisol by taking samples of saliva from the cheek; researchers wanting to understand the brain look to voxel activation with fMRI, or cortical neuron activation with EEG.\n |\nBehavioral Coding. Sometimes, it‚Äôs easier to have research assistants observe the physical behaviors of interest. For example, y‚Äôall served as behavioral coders when you counted the number of interruptions (a behavior!) Other times, research assistants will observe real-life interactions and observe variables such as time spent talking, distance between participants, or provide ratings of how much emotion or anxiety the person seemed to be expressing (using a rating scale). The ‚Äústrange situation‚Äù task (where a parent leaves the room and researchers observe what a child does) is another example.6\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n‚ÄúExternal‚Äù. Researchers like observational methods because they, by definition, require some outward expression of the underlying psychological processes. Professor could go on a rant here and won‚Äôt, but psychology has been increasingly fixated on behavior since Watson kicked off the behaviorism movement in the 1920s, and these data are often prioritized, since our field loves predicting people‚Äôs actual behavior (so they can exert power over it).\nLess influenced by self-report biases. Observers are considered to be less biased than individuals, who may be particularly prone to self-enhancement, self-diminishment. And observers may be able to fill in the gaps left behind by self-insight bias. For example, a person‚Äôs close friends may know more about the individual‚Äôs reputation than they themselves do.\nMore reliable (multiple sources). While there is only one self to provide a self-report, there can be multiple observers. Indeed, observational methods almost always leverage this power and require multiple swabs of spit to get a reliable estimate of cortisol, or have multiple research assistants rate the same behavior to check and make sure they are each getting a similar answer.\n\n\n\nLimitations\n\nTime-Intensive. It can be incredibly costly to collect observational data. Yale charges over $600/hour for use of their fMRI machine (Berkeley doesn‚Äôt list their prices), and conducting a study to measure a naturally occurring behavior could take years between designing the study, recruiting and training the research assistants to observe the behavior, taking the time to collect the data, and then doing the behavioral coding necessary to convert the observations into numbers. Whew. Much easier to just give someone a survey and have them complete it.\nThe Hawthorne Effect. The act of observation can often change behavior. Couples may be less likely to fight if they know they are being monitored by a psychologist, and even light changes its behavior depending on the way it is observed. Researchers can take steps to address this change in behavior - and sometimes the power of the phenomenon is so large that it doesn‚Äôt matter if a researcher is there. In couples studies, for example, researchers can get couples to fight by having each person write out a list of things that cause conflict in the relationship, and then having the people trade lists and talk about it. Often however, individuals habituate to the presence of observation - do you think about the fact that your online interactions are being harvested by tech companies every day, or just kinda get used to it?\nNot all aspects of psychology are observable. A person‚Äôs subjective experience matters, and sometimes a self-report is the only way you can get this data. If you look like you are smiling and have the neurotransmitter levels that suggest you are happy, but feel miserable, are you happy?\n\n\n\n\nTLDR : there are lots of different methods to measure what individuals are like, and for your final project you probably will want to give people self-report surveys to keep things simple for this very first study!",

    "text": "Definition & Theory\nA likert scale is a common survey method psychologists use to measure continuous variation. Likert scales can be used for self-report surveys (where an individual answers questions about themselves), or given to observers (where an individual answers questions about another person - either someone they know, or someone they are actively observing).¬†For example, to the right is an example likert scale - the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale7. Here‚Äôs a link to take the survey and get feedback.\n\n\n\nBelow are some common terms we will use when describing likert scale. (There‚Äôs a video that goes over these terms with another example below too.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nDefinition\nUsage / Example\n\n\nScale\nThe variable that you want to measure as a continuous variable.\nSelf-esteem is often measured with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (1965)\n\n\nItem(s)\nThe specific question(s) in the scale. Each item measures some aspect of the variable the researcher is interested in.\nThe Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE; 1965) is a ten item scale, which means it has ten questions about self-esteem.\n\n\nResponse Scale\nHow people answer the scale items. People give a number rating on a fixed range of options with labels. Many 5-point scales include the following labels (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree; 3 = Neutral; 4 = Agree; 5 = Strongly Agree.)\nThe RSE was originally written to use a 4-point rating scale from 0 (Strongly Disagree) to 3 (Strongly Agree). When Professor includes the RSE in his studies, he might change the response scale to go from 0-4 to so it has an odd-number of answers to allow people to say they are ‚Äúneutral‚Äù.\n\n\nPositively-\nKeyed Item\nAn item that measures the high end of the scale, where answering ‚Äúyes‚Äù to the question means you are high on this variable.\n‚ÄúOn the whole, I am satisfied with my life‚Äù is a positively-keyed item, because answering 4 (Strongly Agree) means the person says they are high in self-esteem.\n\n\nNegatively-Keyed Item\nAn item that measures the low end of the scale, where answering ‚Äúyes‚Äù to the question means you are low on the variable.\n‚ÄúI certainly feel useless at times‚Äù is a negatively-keyed item, because answering 4 (Strongly Agree) means the person says they are low in self-esteem.\n\n\nReverse Scoring\nHow researchers ‚Äúflip‚Äù the negatively-keyed items to be positively-keyed. To calculate how to reverse-score an item, you can add the lower and upper limit of the full range. So to reverse-score a response scale that goes from 0 to 4 = 0 + 4 = subtract the negatively keyed items from 4. A response scale that goes from 1 to 15 = 1 + 15 = subtract the negatively keyed items from 16. And so on.\nThis is confusing. We will practice in lecture some more, okay?\nTo reverse score the negatively-keyed item, you would subtract the person‚Äôs 4 from 4 (since the scale range is 0 to 4, so 0+4 = 4). A response of 4 (Strongly Agree) to the question I certainly feel useless at times means that for this question, the person‚Äôs self-esteem would be rated as a 0.\nPOP QUIZ : a survey has a response scale that goes from 1-7. What number would you subtract from in order to reverse score a negatively-keyed item?8\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Likert Scales\n\nThey are easy to administer as a self-report or observational survey, and provide structured data.\nThe principle of aggregation describes a phenomenon where combining multiple items into one scale will provide a more reliable and continuous measure. Remember, the normal distribution is a theoretical distribution that exists when there are multiple explanations for one variable that occur randomly in a population. The multiple items in a scale are one way to try and measure the multiple random explanations for variation. And indeed, as you‚Äôll see in the R demonstration, when you combine multiple categorical items into one variable, the distribution of the variable looks more normal than any individual item.\nResearchers can assess the reliability of the multiple items that were included in the measure. For example, if we are reliably measuring extraversion, then there should be. Cronbach‚Äôs (alpha) is a statistic that estimates the internal consistency (reliability) of a scale, and is based on (a) the similarity of people‚Äôs responses to the items in a scale (the more similar, the higher the reliability) and (b) the number of items in a scale (sales with many items will tend to have higher cronbach than will likert scales with just a few items.) There‚Äôs no official ‚Äúrule‚Äù for what‚Äôs considered good or bad alpha, but below are some guidelines:\n\nŒ± &gt; .8 = GREAT! Your scale is reliable\nŒ± = .5 - .7 = OKAY! Your scale has low reliability, so something may be wrong with your measure.\nŒ± &lt; .5 = UH OH‚Ä¶your scale has really low reliability. Below are a few possible reasons:\n\nyour scale only has a few items: remember, that Œ± is influenced by the number of items in your scale; so scales with a few items will almost certainly have a low alpha reliability.\nwere the items in scale incorrectly coded (reverse scored items)?\nis the scale measuring different things (no consistency)? It could be that your scale isn‚Äôt very precise, and is measuring different variables.",

    "text": "In R : Creating a Likert Scale\nIn this demonstration, we‚Äôll use the class dataset to create a scale to measure differences in EXTRAVERSION. To do this, we will need to complete the following steps:\n\n1. Import and Check the Data.\nFirst, we‚Äôll need to load the data, and check to make sure it is imported correctly. You can access these data here - personality measures of extraversion (how social people say they are) and conscientiousness (how organized people say they are).\n\nec &lt;- read.csv(\"../datasets/ec_data.csv\") # Note: make sure to change the *path* in the `read.csv()` function to point R to the correct spot to import the ec dataset from YOUR computer.\n\n\n\n2. Create a data.frame that isolates the items in the scale.\nNow, I‚Äôll just create a smaller dataframe of the variables that I want to work with for the extraversion scale. From the codebook, I see that the extraversion scale is made up of the items e1-e6r, with the r indicating items that are negatively-keyed.\n\nextra.df &lt;- data.frame(ec$e1, ec$e2, ec$e3, # the three positively keyed items\n                    ec$e4r, ec$e5r, ec$e6r) # the three negatively keyed items\nhead(extra.df) # this code checks my work and make sure my newly created dataframe in fact contain the positively and negatively keyed items\n\n  ec.e1 ec.e2 ec.e3 ec.e4r ec.e5r ec.e6r\n1     2     3     2      4      4      4\n2     2     4     3      3      3      4\n3     3     4     2      4      5      4\n4     2     3     2      3      4      3\n5     5     5     5      1      1      1\n6     1     3     3      3      4      4\n\n\n\n\n3. Correctly reverse-score the negatively-keyed items in the scale.\nNow, I need to reverse-score the negatively keyed items. Since the scale ranged from 1 to 5, I need to subtract the negatively keyed items from 6 to reverse the scoring (so 6 - 1 = 5, and 6 - 5 = 1.)\nNote that you can calculate how to reverse-score an item by adding the lower and upper limit of the full range. So to reverse-score a response scale that goes from 0 to 4 = 0 + 4 = subtract the negatively keyed items from 4. A response scale that goes from 1 to 15 = 1 + 15 = subtract the negatively keyed items from 16. And so on.\nI can again use the head() function to check my work and confirm that I successfully reverse scored the variables. Note that you can reverse-score the variables in one step; I don‚Äôt really do this twice when creating a scale :)\n\nextra.df &lt;- data.frame(ec$e1, ec$e2, ec$e3, # the three positively keyed items\n                    6-ec$e4r, 6-ec$e5r, 6-ec$e6r) # the three negatively keyed items\nhead(extra.df) # this code checks my work and make sure my newly created dataframe in fact contain the positively and negatively keyed items. Note that there seems to be more consistency in the scores for each individual - people who are low in e1-e3 are now also low in e4r - e6r.\n\n  ec.e1 ec.e2 ec.e3 X6...ec.e4r X6...ec.e5r X6...ec.e6r\n1     2     3     2           2           2           2\n2     2     4     3           3           3           2\n3     3     4     2           2           1           2\n4     2     3     2           3           2           3\n5     5     5     5           5           5           5\n6     1     3     3           3           2           2\n\n\n\n\n4. Evaluate the reliability of the items in this variable.\nI‚Äôll examine the internal reliability of the scale. Internal reliability measures how consistent people‚Äôs responses were for each of the items of the scale.

This is good, and would be something that I would report when describing the measure of Extraversion.\nThe rest of the code output gives you other statistics on the scale (e.g., the mean or standard deviation), and shows you what the reliability of the scale would be if you removed one of the items from the scale. This can be useful for diagnosing whether there was an issue with your code (e.g., did you forget to reverse-score one item?) or with the scale (e.g., is one of your items actually measuring something other than extraversion?) In this case, the reliability doesn‚Äôt change much if we remove any of the items.\n\n\n5. Use the rowmeans() function to create a new variable that is the average of each person‚Äôs items.\nNow, I need to create one variable that is combines all the items into one number. To do this, I could either add up each person‚Äôs 6 extraversion scores, or take the average. The convention is usually to take the average for personality variables - not sure why‚Ä¶a cultural difference.\nSo we will use the rowMeans() function to do this. There are two methods for this.\n\nMethod #1 (Default - very conservative approach) : only calculate an average score if people answered every item in the dataset. This completely removes a person from the dataset, even if they answered 5/6 of the questions.\n\nthis calculates the average of these items for each row (individual) in the dataset. This is the measure of extraversion for each person. Notice that there is some missing data - the default for this code is that a person‚Äôs data will be totally removed if they didn‚Äôt answer all the questions in the scale. This is a very conservative way to handle missing data.\n\n    rowMeans(extra.df) \n\n [1] 2.166667 2.833333 2.333333 2.500000 5.000000 2.333333 3.333333 3.666667\n [9] 2.833333 2.333333 2.000000 3.500000 4.166667 2.333333 4.500000 3.166667\n[17]       NA 3.666667 3.000000 3.666667       NA 3.500000 3.666667 4.000000\n[25] 1.666667 4.833333 3.666667 3.833333 3.166667 3.000000 2.500000 2.833333\n[33] 1.000000 2.833333 3.333333 3.000000 3.166667 2.166667 2.333333 3.166667\n[41] 1.833333 3.000000 3.166667 4.333333 4.166667 3.500000 3.500000 2.166667\n[49] 4.833333 1.666667\n\n\n\nMethod #2 (more liberal approach) : this removes missing data from specific items, so the average score will be calculated even if the person didn‚Äôt answer some of the items.¬†\n\n\nrowMeans(extra.df, na.rm = T) #     adding na.rm = T as an argument. \n\n [1] 2.166667 2.833333 2.333333 2.500000 5.000000 2.333333 3.333333 3.666667\n [9] 2.833333 2.333333 2.000000 3.500000 4.166667 2.333333 4.500000 3.166667\n[17] 3.800000 3.666667 3.000000 3.666667 2.800000 3.500000 3.666667 4.000000\n[25] 1.666667 4.833333 3.666667 3.833333 3.166667 3.000000 2.500000 2.833333\n[33] 1.000000 2.833333 3.333333 3.000000 3.166667 2.166667 2.333333 3.166667\n[41] 1.833333 3.000000 3.166667 4.333333 4.166667 3.500000 3.500000 2.166667\n[49] 4.833333 1.666667\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT In order to save the output as a variable, you will need to assign the output of rowMeans() to a new object, ideally one that is saved as part of the original dataset.\n\n\nec$EXTRAVERSION &lt;- rowMeans(extra.df, na.rm = T) # this saves the scales to the dataset as a new object (which I'm calling EXTRAVERSION). I like to name variables that I create in ALL CAPS. Note that I've chosen to be less conservative in how I handle missing data.\n\n\n\n6. Graph this variable and interpret the graph (what do you learn)?\nOkay, we have a scale! And this scale should measure continuous variation! Let‚Äôs graph it. I‚Äôm looking for a graph that ranges from 1 to 5 (since that was the limit of my response scale), and something that looks mostly normally distributed.\n\nhist(ec$EXTRAVERSION, main = \"\", col = 'black', bor = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks good. When I look at this graph I see the following things:\n\nthe range of the scale goes from 1 to 5. This is good, because the response scale ranged from 1 to 5. An incorrect range would suggest that I made a mistake when analyzing the data.\nthe graph is mostly normally distributed. This is also good, and expected for a personality variable like Extraversion. If there was some extreme skew, I might again think that I made a mistake when creating the scale, or wonder if there was some non-random variable that was influencing students‚Äô extraversion scores (for example, the entire cohort of students took an improv class during orientation).\nthere is some slight positive / right skew - there are a few students who are maxed out on extraversion. What‚Äôs up extraverts [waves furiously]. Not sure why that is, but some deviation from normality is always expected! Ooh, one theory is that this survey was given out at the end of a three-hour lecture, so maybe students who were more extraverted were more likely to stick around in a large classroom setting, and thus more likely to be included in the survey. This is an example of sampling bias.",

    "section": "The Scientific Method in 5 Easy Steps",
    "text": "The Scientific Method in 5 Easy Steps\nSo, you‚Äôve defined a research question you are interested in? Yeah! The Scientific Method is used to help science progress toward valid (accurate, ‚Äútrue‚Äù) predictions and avoid biases. This is the same scientific method you may have learned about in a previous science class or used for a science fair project1. There are five parts, described below.\n\nStep 1 : Identify a Question\nFirst, a researcher starts with a question about the variable that they want to predict or the psychological phenomenon they are interested in. In Chapter 1, we talked about how these questions are often informed by the researcher‚Äôs own observations or experiences.¬†\nStill looking for a project topic? A few ideas to consider :\n\nThink about why you become a psychology major. Was it because you were interested in people, find dreams fascinating, wonder if you could get good at detecting people‚Äôs lies? Think about these interests, then think about what variables might be relevant. For example, while you won‚Äôt have access to an fMRI machine (or the required statistics) in order to reconstruct images people see during their dreams, you might study people‚Äôs beliefs about the importance of their dreams, or the extent to which they have dreams.\nFocus on a problem you‚Äôve encountered or observed in real-life. Notice that something in the world could be better? How would you label that as a variable? For example, maybe you want to better understand people‚Äôs attitudes about capitalism or racism or housing costs.\nLook at faculty webpages, and see what they (and / or their graduate students) are studying. Does anything seem interesting to you? Who looks like they might be cool to work with? What aspects of their research question might you study with this project?\nChase the latest trends of today. What‚Äôs capitalism care about these days? AI?\n\nBut you don‚Äôt have to take my word for it. Here‚Äôs another guide that might offer some help, or ask for help in the class discord / office hours / lecture!\n\nStep 2 : Develop a Theory\nA scientific theory is one that is comprehensive, explanatory, and supported by evidence. For example, the theory of evolution is comprehensive (it relates to all nature, not just plants or animals or finches), it is explanatory (it‚Äôs why we and cats both narrow our eyes when we are scared and angry), and it is supported (by over 100 years of evidence2).¬†\nRECAP : Statistical Models as a Question & Theory:\nAs discussed in Lecture 1, a scientific model identifies the variables that a researcher wants to predict (the dependent variable = the focus of the question) and the variables that the researcher thinks will explain the dependent variable (the independent variables).¬†\nFor example, if my question is ‚ÄúWhat causes rain to fall in the sky?‚Äù, then my dependent variable would be listed as rain (sometimes it rains; sometimes it does not). If my theory is that it rains because there are dark clouds in the sky, then I would write my model as¬† : rain ~ clouds + error.\nMost scientists refrain from saying that a theory is ‚Äúproven‚Äù or ‚Äútrue‚Äù for two reasons:\n\nFirst, the scientific method is a process - our knowledge and ideas are continually updated. So it‚Äôs likely that the theory of evolution will be updated as we learn more about the complex ways genes replicate and interact with the environment. Saying that a theory is ‚Äúproven‚Äù is a common mistake - watch out for it!¬†\nSecond, most scientists (and psychologists) draw from Karl Popper‚Äôs philosophy of science, which adheres to a requirement for science called falsifiability - the ability to find evidence that rejects a theory (‚Äúability to falsify‚Äù). This means a theory is never ‚Äòproven‚Äô because scientists are continually looking for evidence to reject the theory. It also means that a belief that cannot be tested or rejected would be rejected as a scientific belief - you have to be able to test your belief in some observable way. Falsifiability is where I think science separates from religious belief - someone with faith doesn‚Äôt need evidence, and that‚Äôs okay! It just doesn‚Äôt make the belief scientific under science‚Äôs narrow definition.¬†\n\nHypotheses are specific predictions that researchers make about what they expect to see in the data if their theory is supported or is not supported by data.¬†\n\nThe alternative hypothesis (sometimes written HA) is the researcher‚Äôs own belief. It may seem strange to label your belief ‚Äúalternative‚Äù when this word is used for things that are supposed to be different (‚Äúalternative rock = it‚Äôs not your parent‚Äôs rock & roll!‚Äù), and we are so used to thinking that our beliefs are the default that to call them alternative seems wrong. This is an example of previous beliefs bias, and the decision to label our beliefs as the ‚Äúalternative‚Äù is an example of science trying to correct this bias. It‚Äôs a small and symbolic correction, but it‚Äôs better than nothing.\nThe null hypothesis (sometimes written H0) is the label given for whatever evidence would not support the researcher‚Äôs belief.\n\nEXAMPLE : Let‚Äôs say you believe that smoking cannabis hurts a person‚Äôs memory. What‚Äôs the alternative hypothesis? What‚Äôs the null?\n\nNull Hypothesis : People who smoke cannabis will perform BETTER or NO DIFFERENT on a memory test than people who do not smoke marijauna.\nAlternative Hypothesis : People who smoke cannabis will perform WORSE on a memory test than people who do not smoke marijauna.\nMany students forget to include the ‚ÄúNO DIFFERENT‚Äù in the null hypothesis example above. However remember that the null hypothesis is everything that your theory is not. So if your theory is that smoking cannabis HURTS memory, then finding no difference in the memory of pot smokers vs.¬†non-smokers would not support your theory, and is thus part of the null hypothesis. (Note : some of y‚Äôall may have missed this because you are remembering learning about ‚Äúdirectional‚Äù vs ‚Äúnon-directional‚Äù hypotheses - we will discuss this more in Lecture 8.)\n\nCheck-In : Identifying Models, Null, and Alternative Hypotheses.Let‚Äôs review with a quick check-in to practice identifying models based on research questions and theories, and identifying the null and alternative hypotheses based on a given theory. As a reminder, check-ins are required, graded for completion, and will be used for you and me to gauge understanding.\n\n\nStep 3 : Collect Data\nAs described above, scientific theories are supported by evidence called data. How researchers collect data is something we will discuss in more detail over the next few weeks. In general, researchers have to figure out how to measure the variables they are interested in studying (e.g., ‚Äúhow will I know if someone is happy or not?‚Äù), and then find participants (people or animals) to study (e.g., ‚Äúwhose happiness should I study‚Äù).¬†\nFor example, in our smoking cannabis example the decisions about how to measure memory (a music memory game or a word recognition task?) or how much cannabis (a little or a lot?) or who to study (Berkeley students or your grandparents?) in the study would likely influence the results.\nThe decisions that researchers make about how to define their measures and the participants they will study are very important, and will influence the results of the study (and thus our knowledge of the topic), so stay tuned for more discussion!\n\n\nStep 4 : Use Data to Test Theories\nFinally, researchers look to see if the data they collected supports or rejects their theory (and evaluate how strongly their theory is supported or rejected). We‚Äôll talk much more about using data to test theories this semester.\nIn our smoking cannabis example, the researcher would look to see which group did better on the memory test, and if the smokers did worse, then their theory would be supported (by this one study, at least).\n\n\nStep 5 : Repeat\nOnce a study is completed, researchers repeat the scientific method in two different ways.\nResearchers will sometimes repeat the exact same steps a second time - something called replication. Replication is critical to science.\nScientists also repeat the scientific method with a new question that is based on the results from their first study. Science is a process, and researchers are never done learning about how to better predict & control the world. There‚Äôs always more research to do. For example, after identifying a pattern between smoking cannabis and memory, a researcher might ask whether the type or dosage of cannabis intake would influence memory, whether abstinence could reverse the effects of memory impairment, or whether cannabis and coffee together might lead to a different result. Note that this is not an example of replication, since researchers are not testing the same question they had - but it‚Äôs repeating the scientific method for a new question inspired by the old. This is good, and part of scientific progress. But the problem is that the incentives for scientific publication focused almost entirely on ‚Äúnew‚Äù research, and not really making sure that the ‚Äúold‚Äù research was valid.\n\n\nIt‚Äôs Never Actually Easy\nScience is hard, and people are very complex, which makes psychological science very hard. Unfortunately, psychology is in a bit of a Replication Crisis. This crisis is two-fold a) researchers tend not to seek to replicate their (or others‚Äô) results, and b) systematic attempts to do so have suggested that the majority of results in psychology do not replicate3.",

And as we have (and will continue to discuss) there are still many ways in which racism (and sexism, classism, and ableism) occur and affect psychology (and other sciences too).\nFor example, more modern intelligence testing is often criticized for prioritizing White European values and language in the way it assesses supposedly ‚Äúobjective‚Äù knowledge. In an important test of this claim, the psychologist Robert Williams (pictured to the right) designed an IQ test that was as reliable as the default IQ test, but was ‚Äúbiased‚Äù to prioritize and value Black culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in the table, Black students scored higher on this IQ test than White students - a point he (and others) use to emphasize the inherent biases in intelligence testing.

However, the TLDR is something like this :\n\nResearcher has an idea! They assemble a team of others interested in the idea, and do a literature review in order to gain background knowledge on the topic.\nResearcher designs a study, collects data, analyzes the data, and writes up the data as a report. All the steps of the scientific method. This is what you will do for the final project!\nResearcher submits the report to a scientific journal. A journal is a collection of articles that are usually united by some common theme. In general, the shorter the name of the journal, the more prestigious5. For example, the ‚ÄúJournal of Research in Personality‚Äù is considered less prestigious than the ‚ÄúJournal of Personality and Social Psychology‚Äù, which is less prestigious than the journal called ‚ÄúPsychological Science‚Äù, which is considered less prestigious than the journal called ‚ÄúScience‚Äù.¬†\nAn editor decides whether to review or reject the article. Editors make an initial decision - based on a summary of the study and a letter that the author writes to the editor - whether the research article might be a good fit for the journal. If so, they pass it along to the next step. If not, they send a ‚ÄúThanks, but‚Ä¶.‚Äù rejection letter.\nThe editor sends the article to peer-reviewers. Peer reviewers are other researchers who have some related research interests or skills in the topic of the paper. They will look over the article. The editor may know these people, or they get asked by another peer-reviewer who didn‚Äôt want to do it but nominated someone else to step into the role. Peer-reviewers work on a completely voluntary basis - it‚Äôs seen as required service, and there‚Äôs a bit of professional reputation to maintain in doing this work. Yes, there are problems with unpaid labor in academia. We can chat about that if you‚Äôd like; ask questions / raise it as an issue on Discord.\nThe editor makes a decision on the paper based on the feedback from the peer-reviewers. The editor summarizes the feedback, and either accepts the paper, accepts as long as the person makes necessary revisions, asks the researcher to ‚ÄúRevise and Resubmit‚Äù (this is called an R&R - probably the most common outcome, and does not guarantee that the paper will be accepted if the revisions are made, but will get sent out to peer-reviewers again), or rejects the paper. In any case, the author will see the comments made by the peer-reviewers and the editor.\nThe (accepted) paper goes to a proofreader and is published. Hooray! This process probably takes anywhere from 6 months (insanely fast) to 2 years (or more, depending on the number of revisions that are required).",

    "text": "Types of Research Articles\nWe‚Äôll learn how to read and dissect scientific articles this semester, but first it will be important to learn how to identify There are a few different types of articles that researchers write :\n\nOriginal Reports : An original report is where the researcher(s) write about the results of a novel study they did to test some theory. This means the researchers did something ‚Äúnew‚Äù - usually they collected and analyzed new data to test a theory, or analyzed existing data in a new way. Here‚Äôs an example of an original report on the topic of emotion regulation.\nReplication : A replication is a type of study where a researcher repeats the steps they (or another) researcher did, and sees if they get the same result. As we discussed, psychology (and many other fields) is in a replication crisis. This type of article was not very common before the 2010s, but is more common now. Still, faculty tend to be biased toward producing original reports - a school like Berkeley or Stanford would not hire a researcher just for doing replications. Here‚Äôs an example of a replication on the topic of emotion regulation. Note this is not really a direct replication, since they replicated in a different population.\nMeta-Analyses : A meta-analysis is where researchers take other people‚Äôs data, collect it, and analyze it in order to see broad trends across an entire field. For example, a meta-analysis might take all the research on whether there‚Äôs a relationship between playing violent video games and violent behavior, and analyze this existing research in terms of common themes, such as the type of video games the researchers studied, the measures of violence, and the results. Meta-Analyses can be a great way to look at a broad trend, but they rely on the assumption that the individual studies they summarize are, in fact, valid themselves. That is, if there are systematic biases in the way researchers study a topic, the Meta Analysis won‚Äôt solve or even identify those problems. Here‚Äôs an example of a meta-analysis done on the topic of emotion regulation.\nReview Article : Review articles summarize existing research without doing any additional data analysis (in contrast to a Meta-Analysis, in which there is data analysis of past research). This is the closest thing to a paper you might write in an English class - the authors take past research, summarize it in terms of common themes, and maybe highlight limitations, or new directions the field might take. Review articles are a great way to get a broad overview of a topic, since they summarize and organize past research, and will often highlight next steps that researchers should take. Here‚Äôs an example of a review article done on the topic of emotion regulation.",

    "section": "The Peer Review Process",
    "text": "The Peer Review Process\nIn order to publish their results, researchers have their peers review their work, and provide comments or suggestions. The peer-review process ideally serves two purposes :¬†\n\nPeer Reviewers Help Improve the Research. The peers doing the reviewing are supposed to have expertise in the topic of the paper. This allows them to suggest ways to improve the paper. These suggestions can run from the simple (such as recommending other researchers to reference in the introduction or additional analyses to run) to very involved (suggestions for additional studies to run, different methods to use, or different people to study).\nPeer Reviewers Provide a Vote of Confidence in the Ideas and Analyses of the Paper. The editor of a journal will look to the peer reviewers for evidence that the research is ‚Äúhigh quality‚Äù and / or novel enough to be published. There‚Äôs a fair amount of bias here - some reviewers think the research is good but not considered a ‚Äúgood fit‚Äù for the journal. But the ‚Äúpeer-reviewed‚Äù label of a journal gives at least one layer of confidence that some other people like this research.\n\nOne important aspect of the peer-review process is that the peer-reviewers are anonymous to the author, and sometimes the author is anonymous to the peer-reviewers. Ideally, this helps prevent previous beliefs bias (since some researchers may have positive or negative impressions of each other) and social influence bias (since a famous researcher at a fancy school may have their research more trusted than someone with less prestige to their name or institution). However, psychological fields are often small enough that people tend to know who‚Äôs doing what research, and there are other cues that can tip peer-reviewers off about who the author of a study is (for example, the author of a study will likely reference their own work, since their new study builds off their old study.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Publishers are Predatory Capitalists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know how the music business can hurt artists and interrupt the free flow of groovy music??? Well, academic publishers are no different, and can make profits in the billions of dollars. They do this by charging exorbitant fees for accessing peer-reviewed articles, and not paying the researchers who publish papers any money. That‚Äôs right; researchers get a 0% commission of any sales of their academic articles. It is a horrible and corrupt system that deserves to die.\nBut you don‚Äôt have to take my word for it! You can read more about the problem with publishers and a (controversial) solution - sci-hub - here. Here‚Äôs an [OPTIONAL] longer articlethat goes into the history of academic publishing, and why it‚Äôs so corrupt. Here‚Äôs a videothat covers some of the same info. Here‚Äôs an even longer article that goes into sci-hub and ‚Äúscientific communism‚Äù. Feel free to skim or skip all of this!

    "text": "Finding Research Articles\nNext week we will find research articles related to YOUR research interests. I like to use Google Scholar for this - I find the search features powerful and Google will comb the internet for free versions of research articles (so I don‚Äôt have to be on campus or have proxy access to UC Berkeley‚Äôs library or ‚Äústeal‚Äù articles from publishers using sci-hub).\nFor example, searching for one of my dissertation chapters shows this page.\n\n\n\nHow to Find Articles\nSome tips for finding an article related to your topic :¬†\n\nUse the right ‚Äújargon‚Äù. As part of the operationalization process, scientists use specialized terms. What you might call ‚Äúholding it in‚Äù researchers call ‚Äúexpressive suppression‚Äù; a ‚Äújerk‚Äù would be someone ‚Äúlow in agreeableness‚Äù; that feeling of ‚Äúbeing hella stressed before an exam but also low key stepping up because of that stress‚Äù is the ‚Äúpsychophysiological distinction between challenge and threat‚Äù. As you search for research related to your topic, take note of how researchers are describing related phenomena, and adjust your terms as needed. This is part of building your schema for the topic.\nLook at past research on the topic. If you‚Äôve found a relevant article on your topic, it‚Äôs likely that the article has referenced other research that is also relevant. Read or scan through the introduction (or the references section) and see if there‚Äôs something that looks related to your interests.\nLook at future research on the topic. If you found a relevant article on your topic, it‚Äôs likely that other researchers have also read that article, and used it in their future research. Google Scholar has a ‚ÄúCited By‚Äù button []that you can use in order to see more recent articles that have referenced the article you found. This is a particularly useful way to find more recent research if you found a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù in the field, or check for replications or controversies.\nOld Research is Okay! But look for new research too. Many students wonder if an ‚Äúold‚Äù study is still relevant. Some papers are ‚Äúclassics‚Äù in the field, and great to read. But it‚Äôs likely that our field‚Äôs understanding of self-esteem has changed from 1970. If you are hoping to build your schema on a topic, finding a review article from the last 10 years (or 5; or 2!) would be a good place to start.\n\n\n\nHow to Evaluate an Article\nIt can often be overwhelming for students to sift through the masses of research on a topic and know what‚Äôs most important and relevant.¬†\nReading the article and using your critical thinking skills / psychological training is the best approach. To do this, it is recommended to go to Graduate School, where you canspend multiple years reading as much as you want on a beautiful college campus, taking classes where you can deeply engage with the research and ideas, immerse yourself in meaningful intellectual conversations had by other graduate students and kindly professors - the gleam of knowledge and excitement of supporting the next generation of researcher in their eye. Oh, that is not interesting to you / grad schools are flooded with applications / you can‚Äôt get an office hour appointment with your professor who actually / you don‚Äôt have the privilege of spending 5-8 years getting paid near-poverty wages to be a poor scholar?¬†\nWell, below are a few other ideas to make superficial , all depending on our good friend social influence bias :\n\nThe Citation Count. Google scholar allows you to see how many other research articles have referenced the article that you found. While this can be a nice way to see how influential a paper is, a paper could be referenced a lot for reasons other than its validity, and maybe no one has read the most amazing paper in the world.\nThe Impact Factor of the Journal. Journals have different ‚Äúprestige factors‚Äù, and the impact factor is one way to quantify this prestige. Impact factor is usually defined as the number of times the average article in a journal has been referenced by other researchers in a year. So an impact factor of 2 means that each article in that journal is referenced by two other articles in a year. The impact factor is something you have to look up - journals usually track this. I wouldn‚Äôt spend too much time worrying about it, but it‚Äôs a quick way to get a very superficial sense of the journal‚Äôs reputation. For example, let‚Äôs see how the impact factor relates to our rule of ‚Äúbroader journal name = more prestige‚Äù.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJournal\nImpact Factor According to Google in 2024\n\n\nJournal of Research in Personality\n2.6\n\n\nJournal of Personality and Social Psychology\n6.4\n\n\nPsychological Science\n10.1 [couldn‚Äôt find a recent stat on this tho]\n\n\nScience\n44.7 [this escalated quickly]\n\n\n\n\nThe Researcher and Institution. Another way to evaluate an article is by evaluating the author. Does it look like this research has produced other cool research, or do you find their work boring and problematic for some reason? Is this researcher well known and respected in the field? Do they seem to have a happy photo with all their graduate students on their lab website, or is their lab website 10 years old and just has one sad looking graduate student asking for help with their eyes? Has the researcher continued to produce interesting, reliable research? Or were they the subject of a replication scandal?\n\n\n\nVideo Examples : Using Google Scholar to Find Research\n\nUsing Google Scholar\n\n\nHow to find articles, use the right jargon, and do some very superficial evaluations of the article‚Äôs quality.\n\n\n\nExporting APA Citations\n\n\nThe ‚Äú‚Äù button on Google Scholar makes life so much easier!!
