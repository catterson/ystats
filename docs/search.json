    "text": "Why Statistics in Psychology?\nAs y‚Äôall know, this class is a requirement for students who want to be psychology majors. This is exciting for me (your professor), and probably some students too. However, over the years I have learned this can be frustrating and stressful for students who wonder why-the-flip they are required to take a math class when all they just want to learn about people (or other non-human animals), ya know!??!\nI agree that people (or non-human animals) are interesting. And we all have this interest in people (or non-human animals) because we are complex1. While people are similar in many ways, we also differ in radical ways; from superficial features like age and race, to more complex ways like our personality or emotions, to highly specific behaviors such as whether all students in the class are reading these words or not, or how bored or excited (or any emotional experience) students are while reading these words.\nI hope that you have an interest in people (or non-human animals), and that this class helps you learn how to think about those interests through a psychological, and statistical lens. You don‚Äôt always need this lens - and as we will discuss there can sometimes be dangers in viewing people through this lens - but it‚Äôs useful to be able to wear these ‚Äúglasses‚Äù when needed.\n\nStatistics as a Language\nStatistics is a language that scientists use to describe this complexity. While psychology uses this language to better understand differences in people (or non-human animals), other scientific disciplines focus on their own domains; physicists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in matter and energy, chemists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in elements and compounds, botanists seek to understand differences in plants, and economists seek to understand money.\n\nVariables and Variation\nVariation is at the heart of statistics, and is defined by differences, change, and complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween-Person Variation describes how individuals differ from each other. Think about ways that you differ from others; not everybody wears glasses, has the same level of silliness / seriousness / desire to cause mischief / fascination with horses.\n\n\n\nWithin-Person Variation describes how one individual changes over time or across different situations. Think about the person you are today - are you exactly the same as you were yesterday? A year ago? You‚Äôve changed (varied) in ways both small (hunger, exhaustion, number of words you‚Äôve read for this class) and large (personality, love interests, identity, etc.)\n\n\n\nNo variation would describe a situation in which everyone is exactly the same. I can‚Äôt think of too many situations where there is no variation; let me know on Discord if you can think of one? And while there‚Äôs no theoretical limit to the amount of variation that there can be, one major task of this class will be to learn to quantify the amount of variation that we observe in our role as psychologists.\n\nüåûüåûüåû\nüåûüåûüåû\n\n\n\n\nA Variable is a label for some psychological phenomenon that has variation. I‚Äôm not sure where I first heard this, but psychologists often focus on what they call the ‚ÄúABCs‚Äù.¬†\n\nA is for Affect = the emotions that you feel.\nB is for Behavior = the actions that you do.\nC is for cognition = the thoughts you have.\n\nThese are not rigid categories, and psychologists often debate the definitions of these terms. But they can be useful ways to think about how to think about people, and help break down a complex phenomenon into more specific components.\n\n\nPractice : Variables and Variation\nFor example, think about how affect, behavior, and cognition might be relevant if I ask you to think about an upcoming exam (your first exam is in just a few weeks!)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhighlight the cells below to see my ideas / check your understanding\n\n\nAffect Example\nthe feeling of anxiety or dread you have thinking about being assessed, or maybe a feeling of excitement about the opportunity to demonstrate your hard work / effort / knowledge!\n\n\nBehavior Example\nimmediately checking your calendar to see when exams are; or maybe avoiding your classes with a nice procrastination session on the ol‚Äô infinite scroll machine.\n\n\nCognition Example\nthinking about all the work you have to do; wondering why the professor would choose this example when he could have thought about the ways that affect, behavior, and cognition would be triggered when you see a puppy or kitten or something like that‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n(Here‚Äôs a cat video I like for students needing a distraction from thinking about exams. I promise your exams in this class will be chill and I‚Äôll do my best to prepare y‚Äôall.)\n\n\nLanguage is More than Vocabulary\nStatistics is a language that scientists use to describe this complexity. While psychology uses this language to better understand variation in people (or non-human animals), other scientific disciplines focus on their own domains; physicists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in matter and energy, chemists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in elements and compounds, botanists seek to understand differences in plants, and economists seek to understand money.\n\nVocabulary. Equations like ‚Äúthe mean‚Äù or ‚Äústandard deviation‚Äù or ‚Äúcronbach‚Äôs alpha‚Äù or ‚Äúp-value‚Äù are precise vocabulary terms that define some feature of variation. Some of these vocabulary words are easier to understand and remember than others, and like all languages, sometimes people disagree on the definition, and sometimes misuse these words.\nGrammar and Syntax. The way we organize words also matters when learning languages. Saying ‚Äúthe professor graded the students‚Äú has a very different meaning than ‚Äúthe students graded the professor‚Äù, even though these share the exact same words. Statistics (and research methods) also requires precision in the way we organize the ideas, terms, and processes. We‚Äôll learn more about this as we discuss the scientific method (a highly structured and organized approach to doing research), but also as we learn how to navigate doing data analysis.\nCultural Immersion. A good language class will also help students to understand the ways that the language is connected to people, places, and history2. In this class, we‚Äôll think about the ways we can immerse ourselves in the culture of statistics and research methods, from the cultural practices that inform which methods or tools to use, to the ways that the culture of statistics and research might needlessly create barriers for certain types of people or studies.\nPractice and Past Experiences. And yes, in order to gain fluency in a language, you need to practice! Attendance and regular engagement with this class will ensure that you are able to get the practice that you need. It‚Äôs also good to note that people differ in terms of their past experiences with computers and math, and are bringing those experiences (for better or worse) with them into this class.\n\n\n\n\nCulture in Statistics : Me-Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHiya folks! Everyone‚Äôs favorite Open-Source Mickey Mouse here. I‚Äôll be popping up in the book from time to time to critically engage with the idea that statistics has a culture that is socially constructed by people like you!\n\n\n\nAll psychologists are interested in questions sparked by their own observations or experiences. This is sometimes called ‚Äúme-search‚Äù - the idea that a person‚Äôs research interests reflect their own experience.\nMe-search can be an important way for researchers to use their statistics and research methods training to address questions and issues that are relevant to their lives and communities.\nBelow are a few examples of research questions that are related to a person‚Äôs real-life experiences.\n\n\n\nReal Life Experience\nResearch Question\n\n\nA researcher develops vision problems due to his studies of light, and had to live in a completely darkened room, where he became completely isolated from most of reality.3\nDoes reality exist, or can it only be known through our perceptions?\n\n\nA black graduate student at the University of Chicago realizes that white people cross the street to avoid him, and finds himself whistling classical music to signal that he does not fit their negative stereotypes of a black male.4\nHow do people respond and react to others‚Äô negative stereotypes?\n\n\n\nHowever, me-search also serves as a form of potential bias in research - not only will a researcher‚Äôs own biases and beliefs influence the way they conduct research, but the types of questions that are asked will be influenced by the types of people doing research.\nFor example, a survey of over 26,000 research articles in psychology documented just how rarely the topic of race is studied in psychology (see figure below).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we‚Äôll discuss throughout this class, life is complex and there is never one explanation for any phenomenon. However, it‚Äôs important to note that psychology as a field has historically been dominated by white authors (researchers who write scientific papers) and white editors (researchers who decide what papers get published or not).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese trends are important to reflect on, because they reveal a bias in who becomes a psychologist, and what types of questions these researchers are interested in pursuing.\nIt‚Äôs also a goal of this class to not only highlight the important contributions of non-white researchers and statisticians, but also make sure that all students in this diverse classroom feels empowered to use statistics, research methods, and R skills to ask (and answer) research questions that matter to them!5",

R can be intimidating to work with at first, and is more confusing than it needs to be sometimes (as you‚Äôll quickly find out haha), but I promise you will learn! In fact, that‚Äôs the point of this class. It‚Äôs totally okay (and expected) for you to feel frustrated at times; this is part of the learning process. So please embrace the ‚ÄúI HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I‚ÄôM DOING‚Äù dog meme energy (and look how happy the doggy looks!) as you embark on your R journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling R\nUse this link to Download and Install the Programs R and RStudio Desktop\nNote : You must download both R and RStudio Desktop (these are two separate programs). Make sure to download the most recent version of R and RStudio to avoid issues in the future.\n\nR is the powerful, free, and somewhat intimidating computer program that we will use to analyze data in this class. This website is not super friendly - choose the operating system you have (Windows, MacOS, or Linux) and then download the ‚Äúlatest release‚Äù on the next page. If you have a chromebook or iPad / tablet, you will need to use posit.cloud.\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - basically a ‚Äúhome‚Äù for R to live in, with rooms and this program is not 100% necessary, but makes it a little easier to navigate R. Note that you will need to install R first in order for RStudio to work.\n\nHaving trouble getting these programs to work?\n\nHere‚Äôs one YouTube video someone made to show you how to download and install.\nTry posit.cloud. This is a web-based version of RStudio, and has a free option but limits you to 15-hours of work a month. There‚Äôs a paid option for $5/month that you can use; former students pointed out that you can always create a new ‚Äúfree‚Äù account if you run over the 15-hour limit.\nPost on our class Discord / go to section / office hours!

You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it, just look at the definitions of some common sources of psychological knowledge - introductory textbooks :¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúToday, we define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers, 2011)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the science of behavior and the mind.‚Äù (Grey, 2010)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the scientific study of mind, brain, and behavior.‚Äù (Gazzaniga, 2010)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶We now define psychologyas the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers & DeWall, 2018)\n\nI‚Äôm probably showing my age looking to textbooks, so let‚Äôs check in with ChatGPT to see whether the algorithmic summary of large piles of data suggests that psychology is, in fact, a ‚Äúreal science‚Äù :¬†\n\n\nPerhaps more authoritatively, the American Psychological Association (APA) confirms that psychology is, ‚Äúthe study of the mind and behavior‚Ä¶a diverse scientific discipline comprising several major branches of research.‚Äù (APA, 2024).¬†\nThe consistent emphasis on science (and ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù methods!) in these definitions is an attempt to elevate psychology to the status of other ‚Äúhard‚Äù sciences, like physics and chemistry.

    "text": "Psychology as a REAL SCIENCE ‚Ñ¢\nPsychology desperately wants to establish itself as a real science, like physics and chemistry. You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it, just look at the definitions of some common sources of psychological knowledge - introductory textbooks :¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúToday, we define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers, 2011)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the science of behavior and the mind.‚Äù (Grey, 2010)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the scientific study of mind, brain, and behavior.‚Äù (Gazzaniga, 2010)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶We now define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers & DeWall, 2018)\n\nI‚Äôm probably showing my age looking to textbooks, so let‚Äôs check in with ChatGPT6 to see whether the algorithmic summary of large piles of data suggests that psychology is, in fact, a ‚Äúreal science‚Äù :¬†\n\n\nPerhaps more authoritatively, the American Psychological Association (APA) confirms that psychology is, ‚Äúthe study of the mind and behavior‚Ä¶a diverse scientific discipline comprising several major branches of research.‚Äù (APA, 2024).¬†\nThe consistent emphasis on science (and ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù methods!) in these definitions is an attempt to elevate psychology to the status of other ‚Äúhard‚Äù sciences, like physics and chemistry. But inclusion of the term ‚Äúscience‚Äù also seeks to differentiate psychology from its less scientific heritage and past, defend itself from accusations from other scientists / talking heads (if not some of your friends in STEM majors‚Ä¶or parents) that it is not actually REAL SCIENCE ‚Ñ¢.¬†\n\nWhat is Science? Prediction (and Error)\nOne of the most important goals of science is to form predictions, and then use these predictions in order to influence outcomes (a form of power).\nA prediction is an educated guess you have about the future. Educated means that the guess comes from some knowledge (either your experiences, beliefs, something you learned in a textbook, or the results of a scientific study). A prediction can have two outcomes :\n\nValid : your prediction is right\nError : your prediction is wrong.\n\nOf course, things are rarely as simple as ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù, and a large part of this class will be learning how to quantify exactly how much error there is in our scientific predictions.\nAs an example, let‚Äôs look to the stars.\n\n\n\n\nAstronomers have developed knowledge about celestial bodies - gravity, orbits, mass (I know very little about this).\nBut I trust this science because astronomers are able to use it to make very valid predictions about giant space rocks and when they will come close to the earth.7\nI can use this knowledge to plan a stargazing trip, or plan to watch all the rich people leave earth when the ‚Äúbig one‚Äù comes for the rest of us.\n\n\n\nFor our first lecture, start thinking of some predictions that you have made today. What knowledge informed the prediction. Did you use this prediction to influence your future behavior in some way? What kinds of predictions do psychologists make? We will chat more about these ideas in class :) but it‚Äôs a core focus on why psychologists use predictions.\nAnd so, here we are. In this document, in this required class for the psychology major, learning how to DO REAL SCIENCE. With statistics. So Oh yeah, and we‚Äôll also be learning to use this computer programming language called R üòà",

    "text": "Numeric variables\n\nDefinition : Numeric Variable\nNumeric variables are when the value of the variable is a number (e.g., your Extraversion score is 62 on a scale from 0 to 100; or you said ‚Äúum‚Äù fifty times yesterday, or scrolled your phone five times since starting this reading.¬†\nContinuous variables are a special type of numeric variable, with the idea that values of the variable represent an ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù range of possibilities.\nWe often simplify complexity into discrete groups, but for most complex phenomena, I believe that it‚Äôs best to think of life as a spectrum. For example, while I look at my walls and say ‚Äúthey are blue‚Äù, a physicist who really understands color theory would be able to interpret the wavelength of light that is being reflected off these walls, and understands that that wavelength really just a point on an infinite spectrum (bound by a certain range).\n\nPsychologists working in R often use numeric data, and see this as a list (or vector) of numbers. For example, below is data on the narcissism (variable = NPI; a measure of how self-absorbed; self-interested) of a group of Berkeley Haas MBA students were1.\n\nhaas &lt;- read.csv(\"./chapter_data/hormone_data.csv\", stringsAsFactors = T) \nhaas$NPI\n\n  [1] 3.43 4.40 3.13   NA 3.00   NA 3.05   NA   NA 3.63 3.95 3.08 3.83 3.23 3.80\n [16] 1.80 3.68 3.48 2.73 3.40 2.95 3.65 2.88 2.50 3.13 2.75 3.00 3.15 3.30 3.20\n [31] 2.43 3.13   NA 3.33 2.88 2.55 3.35 3.30 3.28 3.08 2.48 2.78 4.58 2.53 2.78\n [46] 2.88   NA 3.43 2.48 3.50 2.40 3.28 3.63 3.13 2.05 2.98 2.53 3.45 2.80 2.60\n [61] 2.05 2.60 2.73 3.25 2.78 2.93 3.08 3.33 4.05 3.65 3.15 3.33 3.98 4.48 3.00\n [76] 3.00 3.25 4.28 3.13 3.83 3.98 4.13 3.73 3.28 2.85 3.28 3.70 3.03 3.38 2.88\n [91] 3.20 3.40 3.70 3.50 2.58 2.90 3.00 3.35 2.63   NA   NA 4.05 3.43 4.28 3.00\n[106] 3.10 3.13 2.83 2.78 2.33 2.68 2.88 2.53 3.80 3.48 3.15 4.38 3.73 3.80 2.60\n[121] 3.38 3.13\n\n\nProfessor Interpretation I learn a lot just from this simple output!\n\nhaas &lt;- read.csv(‚Äú./chapter_data/hormone_data.csv‚Äù, stringsAsFactors = T‚Äù) is the R command that loads the dataset. Note that the path to the datafile - hormone_data.csv - is specific to the way I‚Äôve stored these data in my file system. You‚Äôll learn below how to change this to access your own dataset :)\nhaas$NPI is the R command that was used to generate the output below; a list of 122 individual Narcissism scores.\n\nI know there‚Äôs 122 individual scores because R is keeping count for me using indexing; the numbers in brackets. [1] shows that the first person in the dataset has a narcissism (NPI) score of 3.43; [118] 3.73 shows that this is the score for the 118th person in the dataset, and then I can count up to 122. There are much faster ways to do this, but I can do it this way too :)\nI also see there are a few missing data points in the responses - these are marked as NA. This could be people who didn‚Äôt complete the survey or were excluded for other reasons (e.g.¬†missing data).\n\n\n\n\nGraphing : The Histogram\nThe Histogram is a commonway researchers illustrate numeric variables. We will learn more about principles of good graphing this semester, but the KEY IDEA is to always always always graph your data because A PICTURE IS WORTH 1000 WORDS.¬†\nThe histogram organizes data - you lose the individual values, but gain understanding in seeing how data are grouped together, which helps you observe patterns and get a quick summary of the variable.¬†\nThere are two dimensions of a histogram :¬†\n\nthe x-axis (the horizontal axis; what goes across) : displays the values of the variable as organized into groups (or ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù, in R).¬†\nthe y-axis (the vertical axis; what goes up and down) : displays the frequency (or count) of the individuals in the data who ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to that group.\n\nLet‚Äôs look at our MBA friends again, through the power of a histogram. As you look at a graph, it‚Äôs important to practice thinking about what you learn from the data. Let‚Äôs avoid fancy stats terminology for now; it‚Äôs not necessary for our purposes!!\n\nhist(haas$NPI, xlab = \"Narcissism Score\", col = 'black', bor = 'white', main = \"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe code : this code draws a histogram using the hist() function. I‚Äôve also added several arguments that change some of the default settings to give the graph some digital style.\n\nxlab gives the x-axis of the graph a nice label.\ncolchanges the color of the bars to black.\nbor changes the color of the lines surrounding the bars to white.\nmain changes the title. In this case, \"\" sets the title to be nothing, so there‚Äôs no title.\n\nthe graph : okay, what did R do!\n\nx-axis : this reports the grouped values of the individual narcissism scores.¬†\ny-axis : this reports how many people were in each group.\n\nprofessor interpretation with no fancy stats language needed.\n\nmost people (around 42?) had a narcissism score between 3 and 3.5\na few people were really high in narcissism‚Ä¶above a 4.5. I‚Äôm not sure from the graph exactly how many people were in this group, or what their score was.\na few people were really low in narcissism‚Ä¶below a 2. Again, I‚Äôm not sure from the graph exactly how many people were in this group, or what their score was, but I see their humble selves!\nI also notice that this is not a super large study - the frequencies on the y-axis are relatively low numbers.\n\n\n\n\nActivity : Think about Data!\nOkay, your turn. Below is a graph from the same MBA students, but this time measuring their testosterone levels. Look over the graph, THINK about what you see, and then expand the textbox below (click on the arrow on the right side of the green box) to see what I wrote.\n\nhist(haas$test, \n     xlab = \"Testosterone Level\", main = \"\", \n     col = 'black', bor = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROFESSOR SPOILERS : Expand this textbox when you are ready by clicking on the arrow ‚Äî&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe graph\n\nx-axis : this reports the grouped values of the individual testosterone scores, measured in some kind of density (pg/ML)\ny-axis : this reports how many people were in each group.\n\nwhat I see and observe with no stats language :\n\nmost people (around 25+12+20 = 77) had a testosterone level between 50 and 100.\nthere were no scores below zero (which makes sense) and one person who had a very high level of testosterone. I‚Äôm not a hormone researcher, but the non-negative values seems good, and I might want to make sure that there wasn‚Äôt some data entry error for the extreme score.\nAgain, I notice that this is not a super large study‚Ä¶.and these relatively low numbers seem similar to the narcissism data, which makes sense since they came from the same study.",

So in the color example, the category of color would be the factor, and the different groups of color would be the levels.\nAs another example, researchers can measure gender with categories such as female, male, transgender, and other.

It‚Äôs me again, Open-Source Mickey Mouse to talk with you about the idea that statistics has a culture that is socially constructed by people like you! We live in a society where people in positions of power often have very narrow definitions of what it means to be a person! This manifests in all sorts of ways - you probably feel this pressure when you think about what it means to be a ‚Äúsuccessful student‚Äù.\nOne domain where this is particularly relevant is in the area of gender identity. While many people identify as ‚Äúmale‚Äù or ‚Äúfemale‚Äù, some people don‚Äôt fit into these categories. (Seems pretty simple to me to let folks exist as they want! But I‚Äôm just a poor public servant.) Yet as folks in power have recently forced this narrow binary view of gender identity onto everyone, it becomes even more critical to engage with these ideas and try to define a science that can capture the complexity of human life in ways that let people be their full selves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, most psychological researchers still hold on to Male / Female binaries in the way they measure gender or sex, yet there are many reasons - both scientific and humanistic - to give people more range to express important aspects of their identity3.\nIndeed, categories almost always oversimplify the complexity of life, yet are often used by people (and researchers) because they can sometimes be useful and simple shortcuts for us to understand the world.\nIf you are simply interested in doing a superficial survey of a variable like race, ethnicity, or gender, then I think categorical data can be a fine -if often unscientific - approach, and would recommend giving all people the chance to express their identity in some way.\nHowever, if you are interested in really digging into a variable, then a continuous approach is almost always best. We‚Äôll discuss more on how to do this in a few weeks when we learn about continuous variables and likert scales.\n\n4\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphing : The Categorical Plot\nThe histogram only describes a graph for numeric data, since it organizes numbers into groups (it kind of turns complex variation into more simple categories). When the variable is categorical, people call it a plot ü§∑.\nThis graph looks very similar to our histogram :¬†\n\nthe x-axis (the horizontal axis; what goes across) : displays the levels of the factor variable.\nthe y-axis (the vertical axis; what goes up and down) : displays the frequency (or count) of the individuals in the data who ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to each group.\n\nAlright, back to our good MBA friends. This is a graph of the categorical variable ‚Äúsex‚Äù. Again, look over the graph, THINK about what you see (no stats terminology; what do you learn!), and then highlight my text to see what I wrote about.\n\nplot(haas$sex, col = 'black', bor = 'white', xlab = \"Sex\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Code : this code draws a histogram using the plot() function. Note that I‚Äôve asked R to plot the variable haas$sex. I‚Äôve also added several arguments that change some of the default settings to give the graph some digital style.\n\nxlab gives the x-axis of the graph a nice label.\ncolchanges the color of the bars to black.\nbor changes the color of the lines surrounding the bars to white.\n\nThe Graph :\n\nx-axis : this reports levels (female; male) of the categorical factor variable Sex.¬†\ny-axis : this reports how many people were in each group.\n\nWhat I see and observe with no stats language :\n\nIt appears that the researchers only measured sex as a f/m binary (or that no participants reported a category other than female or male).\nthere were more males than females in this dataset. This matches my perception / stereotype of what a typical MBA program might look like; however I looked into it and Haas reports a larger percentage of female enrollments in the MBA program; so our data may not serve as a representative sample of the true population.6",

    "text": "Part 2 : Working with Datasets\n\nThe Dataframe\n\nDefinition : Rows and Columns\nAs a researcher, you‚Äôll be interested in understanding not only one variable at a time, but will be interested in a dataset - multiple variables about an individual that are organized - in order to see how variables are related to each other (remember : this is a function of the linear model).\nThe datasets in our class will be stored on Dropbox; you can find a link to this on bCourses (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll learn how to load these datasets later in this lecture. For now, what is a dataset?\nA dataset is really a dataframe - a two-dimensional way to organize data - and takes the following structure in this class.\n\nthe rows define the individual in the dataset.¬†rows go across horizontally, like a rowboat going across a lake.\nthe columns define the variables in the dataset. ¬†go up and down vertically; like what might support a bridge.\n\nLook at the example below - again from our budding MBAs in the Haas program. What do you observe about the rows and columns? What does this tell you about the dataset?\n\n\nIn the example dataframe above - I see 5 rows (representing 5 individuals) and five columns (representing five variables like the person‚Äôs age, their sex, their testosterone levels, political ideology, and their NPI (Narcissism) score.¬† or their Race, etc.) Note that the names of the variables do not count as a row, since these are not individuals in the dataset, and you would need to know more about the dataset to know that ideo = political ideology, or test = testosterone. I also see that R is helpfully telling me that this is only a snapshot of the entire dataset - the whole dataframe has 122 entries (rows), meaning that there‚Äôs 122 MBA students in this dataset, and 5 total columns (which we can all see here.)\nAs a researcher, you have access to an entire dataset (either collected by you or another researcher) that organizes multiple variables for each individual. This semester, we‚Äôll work with a variety of datasets on different psychological topics - not just haas students.\n\n\nDefinition : Indexing\nThe dataset gives us access to all the individual rows and columns at once, we will often want to focus on one specific variable (or individual) at a time. Indexing refers to a flexible method of selecting a specific set of data from a larger collection. Previously‚Äô we‚Äôve seen indexing when asking R to produce a large set of numbers; for example asking it to count from 1 to 100.\n\n1:100\n\n  [1]   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18\n [19]  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36\n [37]  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54\n [55]  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72\n [73]  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90\n [91]  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100\n\n\nThe indexing shows up as brackets next to the actual data, and is way for R to index that the [1]st data entry is the number 1, the [24]th entry is the number 24, and so on.\nWhen I ask R to show me the dataset haas, the output can be overwhelming. Below is what R shows you when you ask to see the haas dataset. And this is a relatively small dataset with just 122 individuals (rows) and five variables (columns).\n\nhaas\n\n    age    sex   test ideo  NPI\n1    NA   male     NA   NA 3.43\n2    NA   male 143.89   NA 4.40\n3    NA   male     NA   NA 3.13\n4    30   male     NA    4   NA\n5    28   male     NA    4 3.00\n6    33 female     NA    5   NA\n7    NA   male     NA   NA 3.05\n8    NA   male     NA   NA   NA\n9    NA   male  77.95   NA   NA\n10   NA   male     NA   NA 3.63\n11   26   male 126.29    3 3.95\n12   31   male  59.48    5 3.08\n13   27   male  89.45    4 3.83\n14   27   male  82.80    3 3.23\n15   28   male  97.39    4 3.80\n16   30   male  54.80    4 1.80\n17   28   male  46.07    4 3.68\n18   24   male     NA    4 3.48\n19   32   male  87.40    3 2.73\n20   25   male  85.01    4 3.40\n21   27   male     NA    3 2.95\n22   25   male     NA    4 3.65\n23   24   male 102.86    3 2.88\n24   28   male  73.60    3 2.50\n25   27   male     NA    2 3.13\n26   29   male  90.68    4 2.75\n27   28   male  44.70    3 3.00\n28   29   male     NA    4 3.15\n29   30   male  77.61    4 3.30\n30   26   male  57.20    5 3.20\n31   31   male  49.92    4 2.43\n32   28   male     NA    3 3.13\n33   32   male     NA    5   NA\n34   27   male  85.01    2 3.33\n35   32   male  74.86    2 2.88\n36   27   male 125.89    3 2.55\n37   29   male  77.07    4 3.35\n38   30   male     NA    4 3.30\n39   26   male  30.54    4 3.28\n40   27   male  73.76    3 3.08\n41   32   male  65.61    3 2.48\n42   29   male  51.23    4 2.78\n43   28   male  85.17    3 4.58\n44   28   male     NA    3 2.53\n45   29   male  57.14    2 2.78\n46   30   male  65.31    4 2.88\n47   28   male  53.07    4   NA\n48   28   male 104.65    3 3.43\n49   31   male  90.32    3 2.48\n50   NA female  24.71   NA 3.50\n51   26 female  20.99    3 2.40\n52   27 female     NA    4 3.28\n53   28 female     NA    3 3.63\n54   28 female   5.51    5 3.13\n55   27 female  40.49    4 2.05\n56   25 female  35.05    2 2.98\n57   26 female  57.71    4 2.53\n58   26 female  27.36    4 3.45\n59   27 female  59.37    3 2.80\n60   26 female  21.63    3 2.60\n61   29 female     NA    3 2.05\n62   25 female     NA    7 2.60\n63   37 female  39.50    4 2.73\n64   28 female  42.35    4 3.25\n65   24 female  32.42    3 2.78\n66   29   male  97.63    4 2.93\n67   28   male 131.51    3 3.08\n68   26   male     NA    4 3.33\n69   27   male     NA    5 4.05\n70   29   male     NA    2 3.65\n71   27   male 140.53    2 3.15\n72   26   male     NA    3 3.33\n73   28   male     NA    3 3.98\n74   22   male  90.88    5 4.48\n75   29   male 148.24    5 3.00\n76   29   male 132.24    4 3.00\n77   27   male  82.43    4 3.25\n78   26   male  73.43    4 4.28\n79   35   male     NA    2 3.13\n80   27   male 100.49    4 3.83\n81   25   male  94.31    4 3.98\n82   27   male  72.53    2 4.13\n83   30   male 133.35    4 3.73\n84   27   male  59.77    4 3.28\n85   30   male  91.83    4 2.85\n86   29   male  82.13    3 3.28\n87   30   male 172.15    3 3.70\n88   29   male 228.17    2 3.03\n89   27   male 133.70    3 3.38\n90   27   male  89.24    4 2.88\n91   28   male  88.62    3 3.20\n92   28   male  86.83    4 3.40\n93   25   male 138.65    4 3.70\n94   33   male  59.75    4 3.50\n95   28   male  46.30    3 2.58\n96   31   male 107.02    3 2.90\n97   24   male  60.16    2 3.00\n98   26   male     NA    4 3.35\n99   27   male 107.71    3 2.63\n100  23   male  99.64    2   NA\n101  32   male 131.51    3   NA\n102  29   male  91.94    4 4.05\n103  25   male  53.67    3 3.43\n104  25   male     NA    4 4.28\n105  27 female     NA    4 3.00\n106  27 female  59.24    2 3.10\n107  30 female  28.03    5 3.13\n108  28 female  33.38    5 2.83\n109  26 female  53.31    4 2.78\n110  28 female  27.53    4 2.33\n111  29 female  16.89    4 2.68\n112  25 female  51.53    4 2.88\n113  26 female  37.15    4 2.53\n114  27 female  50.55    2 3.80\n115  28 female     NA    4 3.48\n116  28 female  41.35    5 3.15\n117  29 female  64.66    5 4.38\n118  24 female  37.95    2 3.73\n119  27 female  54.26    4 3.80\n120  27 female     NA    4 2.60\n121  27 female 113.41    4 3.38\n122  29 female  41.35    3 3.13\n\n\nI am overwhelmed with data.

    "text": "The .csv File\n\nDefinition : The .csv File\nAs a researcher, you will work with data that you (or other researcher friends) have collected. The .csv file (csv stands for comma separated variables) is one of the most common formats for storing data that you will encounter. You‚Äôve probably encountered this before, and likely have opened this file type in a program like excel or google sheets. But in this class, we‚Äôll learn to load these files directly into R. Using R has two advantages :\n\nR is way more powerful than excel or Google Sheets.\nR allows us to document all of our steps. This semester, we‚Äôll learn how to make changes to the dataset (e.g., changing the names of a variable; removing bad data; transforming data). It‚Äôs important to be completely transparent about these changes, and doing these changes in R (with an R Script!) will ensure that we document our steps for our future selves / other researchers.\n\n\n\nVideos : How to Load Datasets in R\nThere are two different ways to load a data file into R : one way (‚Äúthe point and click method‚Äù) involves clicking some boxes, like most of y‚Äôall are used to doing. The second way involves typing in an R command. Below are videos that highlight each method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRegardless of which method you use, there are three things you want to check every time you load data : change the name of the dataset (to make it something simple to type and memorable); check the headers (make sure the variables have names, since sometimes), and set stringAsFactors = TRUE (which will automatically convert all your string variables into categorical factor variables, which is almost always what you will want to do in this class.\nThese instructions are highlighted because students often forget. So note the importance! They are important steps!!!\n\n\n\nVideo : Importing Data with the ‚ÄúPoint and Click‚Äù Method and Console Method\n\n\nthe ‚Äúpoint and click‚Äù method of loading data\nthe console / Rscript method of loading data\n\n\n\nVideo : For Posit Users : working with projects and loading data in the cloud.\n{{&lt; video https://youtu.be/HOhINtpyjT4&gt; }}\n\nposit.cloud users!

    "text": "The Dataframe\n\nDefinition : Rows and Columns\nAs a researcher, you‚Äôll be interested in understanding not only one variable at a time, but will be interested in a dataset - multiple variables about an individual that are organized - in order to see how variables are related to each other (remember : this is a function of the linear model).\nThe datasets in our class will be stored on Dropbox; you can find a link to this on bCourses (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll learn how to load these datasets later in this lecture. For now, what is a dataset?\nA dataset is really a dataframe - a two-dimensional way to organize data - and takes the following structure in this class.\n\nthe rows define the individual in the dataset.¬†rows go across horizontally, like a rowboat going across a lake.\nthe columns define the variables in the dataset. ¬†go up and down vertically; like what might support a bridge.\n\nLook at the example below - again from our budding MBAs in the Haas program. What do you observe about the rows and columns? What does this tell you about the dataset?\n\n\nIn the example dataframe above - I see 5 rows (representing 5 individuals) and five columns (representing five variables like the person‚Äôs age, their sex, their testosterone levels, political ideology, and their NPI (Narcissism) score.¬† or their Race, etc.) Note that the names of the variables do not count as a row, since these are not individuals in the dataset, and you would need to know more about the dataset to know that ideo = political ideology, or test = testosterone. I also see that R is helpfully telling me that this is only a snapshot of the entire dataset - the whole dataframe has 122 entries (rows), meaning that there‚Äôs 122 MBA students in this dataset, and 5 total columns (which we can all see here.)\nAs a researcher, you have access to an entire dataset (either collected by you or another researcher) that organizes multiple variables for each individual. This semester, we‚Äôll work with a variety of datasets on different psychological topics - not just haas students.\n\n\nDefinition : Indexing\nThe dataset gives us access to all the individual rows and columns at once, we will often want to focus on one specific variable (or individual) at a time. Indexing refers to a flexible method of selecting a specific set of data from a larger collection. Previously‚Äô we‚Äôve seen indexing when asking R to produce a large set of numbers; for example asking it to count from 1 to 100.\n\n1:100\n\n  [1]   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18\n [19]  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36\n [37]  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54\n [55]  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72\n [73]  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86  87  88  89  90\n [91]  91  92  93  94  95  96  97  98  99 100\n\n\nThe indexing shows up as brackets next to the actual data, and is way for R to index that the [1]st data entry is the number 1, the [24]th entry is the number 24, and so on.\nWhen I ask R to show me the dataset haas, the output can be overwhelming. Below is what R shows you when you ask to see the haas dataset. And this is a relatively small dataset with just 122 individuals (rows) and five variables (columns).\n\nhaas\n\n    age    sex   test ideo  NPI\n1    NA   male     NA   NA 3.43\n2    NA   male 143.89   NA 4.40\n3    NA   male     NA   NA 3.13\n4    30   male     NA    4   NA\n5    28   male     NA    4 3.00\n6    33 female     NA    5   NA\n7    NA   male     NA   NA 3.05\n8    NA   male     NA   NA   NA\n9    NA   male  77.95   NA   NA\n10   NA   male     NA   NA 3.63\n11   26   male 126.29    3 3.95\n12   31   male  59.48    5 3.08\n13   27   male  89.45    4 3.83\n14   27   male  82.80    3 3.23\n15   28   male  97.39    4 3.80\n16   30   male  54.80    4 1.80\n17   28   male  46.07    4 3.68\n18   24   male     NA    4 3.48\n19   32   male  87.40    3 2.73\n20   25   male  85.01    4 3.40\n21   27   male     NA    3 2.95\n22   25   male     NA    4 3.65\n23   24   male 102.86    3 2.88\n24   28   male  73.60    3 2.50\n25   27   male     NA    2 3.13\n26   29   male  90.68    4 2.75\n27   28   male  44.70    3 3.00\n28   29   male     NA    4 3.15\n29   30   male  77.61    4 3.30\n30   26   male  57.20    5 3.20\n31   31   male  49.92    4 2.43\n32   28   male     NA    3 3.13\n33   32   male     NA    5   NA\n34   27   male  85.01    2 3.33\n35   32   male  74.86    2 2.88\n36   27   male 125.89    3 2.55\n37   29   male  77.07    4 3.35\n38   30   male     NA    4 3.30\n39   26   male  30.54    4 3.28\n40   27   male  73.76    3 3.08\n41   32   male  65.61    3 2.48\n42   29   male  51.23    4 2.78\n43   28   male  85.17    3 4.58\n44   28   male     NA    3 2.53\n45   29   male  57.14    2 2.78\n46   30   male  65.31    4 2.88\n47   28   male  53.07    4   NA\n48   28   male 104.65    3 3.43\n49   31   male  90.32    3 2.48\n50   NA female  24.71   NA 3.50\n51   26 female  20.99    3 2.40\n52   27 female     NA    4 3.28\n53   28 female     NA    3 3.63\n54   28 female   5.51    5 3.13\n55   27 female  40.49    4 2.05\n56   25 female  35.05    2 2.98\n57   26 female  57.71    4 2.53\n58   26 female  27.36    4 3.45\n59   27 female  59.37    3 2.80\n60   26 female  21.63    3 2.60\n61   29 female     NA    3 2.05\n62   25 female     NA    7 2.60\n63   37 female  39.50    4 2.73\n64   28 female  42.35    4 3.25\n65   24 female  32.42    3 2.78\n66   29   male  97.63    4 2.93\n67   28   male 131.51    3 3.08\n68   26   male     NA    4 3.33\n69   27   male     NA    5 4.05\n70   29   male     NA    2 3.65\n71   27   male 140.53    2 3.15\n72   26   male     NA    3 3.33\n73   28   male     NA    3 3.98\n74   22   male  90.88    5 4.48\n75   29   male 148.24    5 3.00\n76   29   male 132.24    4 3.00\n77   27   male  82.43    4 3.25\n78   26   male  73.43    4 4.28\n79   35   male     NA    2 3.13\n80   27   male 100.49    4 3.83\n81   25   male  94.31    4 3.98\n82   27   male  72.53    2 4.13\n83   30   male 133.35    4 3.73\n84   27   male  59.77    4 3.28\n85   30   male  91.83    4 2.85\n86   29   male  82.13    3 3.28\n87   30   male 172.15    3 3.70\n88   29   male 228.17    2 3.03\n89   27   male 133.70    3 3.38\n90   27   male  89.24    4 2.88\n91   28   male  88.62    3 3.20\n92   28   male  86.83    4 3.40\n93   25   male 138.65    4 3.70\n94   33   male  59.75    4 3.50\n95   28   male  46.30    3 2.58\n96   31   male 107.02    3 2.90\n97   24   male  60.16    2 3.00\n98   26   male     NA    4 3.35\n99   27   male 107.71    3 2.63\n100  23   male  99.64    2   NA\n101  32   male 131.51    3   NA\n102  29   male  91.94    4 4.05\n103  25   male  53.67    3 3.43\n104  25   male     NA    4 4.28\n105  27 female     NA    4 3.00\n106  27 female  59.24    2 3.10\n107  30 female  28.03    5 3.13\n108  28 female  33.38    5 2.83\n109  26 female  53.31    4 2.78\n110  28 female  27.53    4 2.33\n111  29 female  16.89    4 2.68\n112  25 female  51.53    4 2.88\n113  26 female  37.15    4 2.53\n114  27 female  50.55    2 3.80\n115  28 female     NA    4 3.48\n116  28 female  41.35    5 3.15\n117  29 female  64.66    5 4.38\n118  24 female  37.95    2 3.73\n119  27 female  54.26    4 3.80\n120  27 female     NA    4 2.60\n121  27 female 113.41    4 3.38\n122  29 female  41.35    3 3.13\n\n\nI am overwhelmed with data.

    "text": "16.7 Work on Lab 1 : Predictions & Research Questions.\n\n16.7.1 On Your Own\nDuring our break, think a little bit about what research questions you might want to address for the project in this class. Below are some ideas to help you get started thinking of a research question if you are feeling stuck!\n\nIs there a real-world issue that you care about? What variables make up this questions?\nWhat is something about people (your friends, parents, classmates) that you think is interesting or confusing? What variables are the focus of this interest or question?\nWhat‚Äôs a future career you might want to pursue with your psychology degree? What‚Äôs a variable that is related to this career? What questions might you ask abut this variable?\n\nQuestion 3 (In Lecture / On Your Own). Get started on the final project by thinking through a research question you might be interested in studying as a psychology researcher. (Totally fine to change this, but great to start focusing on a question.)\n\nWhat is your question? Why do you care about this question (and / or why does this question matter to others)? How interested in this question are you on a scale from 0 (just doing to get credit for this question) to 10 (this is what motivates you to wake up each day and you will answer this question with the energy and passion of 1000 suns)?\nHow do your past experiences and background inform this question?\nWhat is the variable that is the focus of this question? How does this variable relate to affect, behavior, and cognition? Which aspect of this variable are you most interested in focusing on for your project?\nWhat is the between-person form of variation for this variable? What is the within-person form of variation for this variable? Note: for the final project, I strongly recommend focusing on a between-person variation version of the variable for the final project.\nDo you have ideas about what might predict or explain this variable (the answer to your question)? How would you write this out as a linear model?\n\n\n\n16.7.2 Student Examples",
