    "text": "Why Statistics in Psychology?\nAs y‚Äôall know, this class is a requirement for students who want to be psychology majors. This is exciting for me (your professor), and probably some students too. However, over the years I have learned this can be frustrating and stressful for students who wonder why-the-flip they are required to take a math class when all they just want to learn about people (or other non-human animals), ya know!??!\nI agree that people (or non-human animals) are interesting. And we all have this interest in people (or non-human animals) because we are complex1. While people are similar in many ways, we also differ in radical ways; from superficial features like age and race, to more complex ways like our personality or emotions, to highly specific behaviors such as whether all students in the class are reading these words or not, or how bored or excited (or any emotional experience) students are while reading these words.\nI hope that you have an interest in people (or non-human animals), and that this class helps you learn how to think about those interests through a psychological, and statistical lens. You don‚Äôt always need this lens - and as we will discuss there can sometimes be dangers in viewing people through this lens - but it‚Äôs useful to be able to wear these ‚Äúglasses‚Äù when needed.\n\nStatistics as a Language\nStatistics is a language that scientists use to describe this complexity. While psychology uses this language to better understand differences in people (or non-human animals), other scientific disciplines focus on their own domains; physicists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in matter and energy, chemists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in elements and compounds, botanists seek to understand differences in plants, and economists seek to understand money.\n\nVariables and Variation\nVariation is at the heart of statistics, and is defined by differences, change, and complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween-Person Variation describes how individuals differ from each other. Think about ways that you differ from others; not everybody wears glasses, has the same level of silliness / seriousness / desire to cause mischief / fascination with horses.\n\n\n\nWithin-Person Variation describes how one individual changes over time or across different situations. Think about the person you are today - are you exactly the same as you were yesterday? A year ago? You‚Äôve changed (varied) in ways both small (hunger, exhaustion, number of words you‚Äôve read for this class) and large (personality, love interests, identity, etc.)\n\n\n\nNo variation would describe a situation in which everyone is exactly the same. I can‚Äôt think of too many situations where there is no variation; let me know on Discord if you can think of one? And while there‚Äôs no theoretical limit to the amount of variation that there can be, one major task of this class will be to learn to quantify the amount of variation that we observe in our role as psychologists.\n\nüåûüåûüåû\nüåûüåûüåû\n\n\n\n\nA Variable is a label for some psychological phenomenon that has variation. I‚Äôm not sure where I first heard this, but psychologists often focus on what they call the ‚ÄúABCs‚Äù.¬†\n\nA is for Affect = the emotions that you feel.\nB is for Behavior = the actions that you do.\nC is for cognition = the thoughts you have.\n\nThese are not rigid categories, and psychologists often debate the definitions of these terms. But they can be useful ways to think about how to think about people, and help break down a complex phenomenon into more specific components.\n\n\nPractice : Variables and Variation\nFor example, think about how affect, behavior, and cognition might be relevant if I ask you to think about an upcoming exam (your first exam is in just a few weeks!)¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhighlight the cells below to see my ideas / check your understanding\n\n\nAffect Example\nthe feeling of anxiety or dread you have thinking about being assessed, or maybe a feeling of excitement about the opportunity to demonstrate your hard work / effort / knowledge!\n\n\nBehavior Example\nimmediately checking your calendar to see when exams are; or maybe avoiding your classes with a nice procrastination session on the ol‚Äô infinite scroll machine.\n\n\nCognition Example\nthinking about all the work you have to do; wondering why the professor would choose this example when he could have thought about the ways that affect, behavior, and cognition would be triggered when you see a puppy or kitten or something like that‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n(Here‚Äôs a cat video I like for students needing a distraction from thinking about exams. I promise your exams in this class will be chill and I‚Äôll do my best to prepare y‚Äôall.)\n\n\nLanguage is More than Vocabulary\nStatistics is a language that scientists use to describe this complexity. While psychology uses this language to better understand variation in people (or non-human animals), other scientific disciplines focus on their own domains; physicists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in matter and energy, chemists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in elements and compounds, botanists seek to understand differences in plants, and economists seek to understand money.\n\nVocabulary. Equations like ‚Äúthe mean‚Äù or ‚Äústandard deviation‚Äù or ‚Äúcronbach‚Äôs alpha‚Äù or ‚Äúp-value‚Äù are precise vocabulary terms that define some feature of variation. Some of these vocabulary words are easier to understand and remember than others, and like all languages, sometimes people disagree on the definition, and sometimes misuse these words.\nGrammar and Syntax. The way we organize words also matters when learning languages. Saying ‚Äúthe professor graded the students‚Äú has a very different meaning than ‚Äúthe students graded the professor‚Äù, even though these share the exact same words. Statistics (and research methods) also requires precision in the way we organize the ideas, terms, and processes. We‚Äôll learn more about this as we discuss the scientific method (a highly structured and organized approach to doing research), but also as we learn how to navigate doing data analysis.\nCultural Immersion. A good language class will also help students to understand the ways that the language is connected to people, places, and history2. In this class, we‚Äôll think about the ways we can immerse ourselves in the culture of statistics and research methods, from the cultural practices that inform which methods or tools to use, to the ways that the culture of statistics and research might needlessly create barriers for certain types of people or studies.\nPractice and Past Experiences. And yes, in order to gain fluency in a language, you need to practice! Attendance and regular engagement with this class will ensure that you are able to get the practice that you need. It‚Äôs also good to note that people differ in terms of their past experiences with computers and math, and are bringing those experiences (for better or worse) with them into this class.\n\n\n\n\nCulture in Statistics : Me-Search\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHiya folks! Everyone‚Äôs favorite Open-Source Mickey Mouse here. I‚Äôll be popping up in the book from time to time to critically engage with the idea that statistics has a culture that is socially constructed by people like you!\n\n\n\nAll psychologists are interested in questions sparked by their own observations or experiences. This is sometimes called ‚Äúme-search‚Äù - the idea that a person‚Äôs research interests reflect their own experience.\nMe-search can be an important way for researchers to use their statistics and research methods training to address questions and issues that are relevant to their lives and communities.\nBelow are a few examples of research questions that are related to a person‚Äôs real-life experiences.\n\n\n\nReal Life Experience\nResearch Question\n\n\nA researcher develops vision problems due to his studies of light, and had to live in a completely darkened room, where he became completely isolated from most of reality.3\nDoes reality exist, or can it only be known through our perceptions?\n\n\nA black graduate student at the University of Chicago realizes that white people cross the street to avoid him, and finds himself whistling classical music to signal that he does not fit their negative stereotypes of a black male.4\nHow do people respond and react to others‚Äô negative stereotypes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, me-search also serves as a form of potential bias in research - not only will a researcher‚Äôs own biases and beliefs influence the way they conduct research, but the types of questions that are asked will be influenced by the types of people doing research.\nFor example, a survey of over 26,000 research articles in psychology documented just how rarely the topic of race is studied in psychology (see figure below).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we‚Äôll discuss throughout this class, life is complex and there is never one explanation for any phenomenon. However, it‚Äôs important to note that psychology as a field has historically been dominated by white authors (researchers who write scientific papers) and white editors (researchers who decide what papers get published or not).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese trends are important to reflect on, because they reveal a bias in who becomes a psychologist, and what types of questions these researchers are interested in pursuing.\nIt‚Äôs also a goal of this class to not only highlight the important contributions of non-white researchers and statisticians, but also make sure that all students in this diverse classroom feels empowered to use statistics, research methods, and R skills to ask (and answer) research questions that matter to them!5",

R can be intimidating to work with at first, and is more confusing than it needs to be sometimes (as you‚Äôll quickly find out haha), but I promise you will learn! In fact, that‚Äôs the point of this class. It‚Äôs totally okay (and expected) for you to feel frustrated at times; this is part of the learning process. So please embrace the ‚ÄúI HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I‚ÄôM DOING‚Äù dog meme energy (and look how happy the doggy looks!) as you embark on your R journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling R\nUse this link to Download and Install the Programs R and RStudio Desktop\nNote : You must download both R and RStudio Desktop (these are two separate programs). Make sure to download the most recent version of R and RStudio to avoid issues in the future.\n\nR is the powerful, free, and somewhat intimidating computer program that we will use to analyze data in this class. This website is not super friendly - choose the operating system you have (Windows, MacOS, or Linux) and then download the ‚Äúlatest release‚Äù on the next page. If you have a chromebook or iPad / tablet, you will need to use posit.cloud.\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - basically a ‚Äúhome‚Äù for R to live in, with rooms and this program is not 100% necessary, but makes it a little easier to navigate R. Note that you will need to install R first in order for RStudio to work.\n\nHaving trouble getting these programs to work?\n\nHere‚Äôs one YouTube video someone made to show you how to download and install.\nTry posit.cloud. This is a web-based version of RStudio, and has a free option but limits you to 15-hours of work a month. There‚Äôs a paid option for $5/month that you can use; former students pointed out that you can always create a new ‚Äúfree‚Äù account if you run over the 15-hour limit.\nPost on our class Discord / go to section / office hours! The professor, other students, or your TA can help get everything working properly.\n\n\n\nNavigating R\nWatch the two videos below for a quick introduction to R - the program we will be using to analyze data.\n\nVIDEO : Navigating R\n\n\nwhat R looks like when you open it\nbasic math in the¬†console\nindexing and output\n\n\n\nVIDEO : Navigating RStudio\n\n\nwhat RStudio/Posit looks like; navigating the program\nbasic math in the console\nthe¬†source file¬†(makes life easier and saves your work!)",

You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it, just look at the definitions of some common sources of psychological knowledge - introductory textbooks :¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúToday, we define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers, 2011)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the science of behavior and the mind.‚Äù (Grey, 2010)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the scientific study of mind, brain, and behavior.‚Äù (Gazzaniga, 2010)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶We now define psychologyas the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers & DeWall, 2018)\n\nI‚Äôm probably showing my age looking to textbooks, so let‚Äôs check in with ChatGPT to see whether the algorithmic summary of large piles of data suggests that psychology is, in fact, a ‚Äúreal science‚Äù :¬†\n\n\nPerhaps more authoritatively, the American Psychological Association (APA) confirms that psychology is, ‚Äúthe study of the mind and behavior‚Ä¶a diverse scientific discipline comprising several major branches of research.‚Äù (APA, 2024).¬†\nThe consistent emphasis on science (and ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù methods!) in these definitions is an attempt to elevate psychology to the status of other ‚Äúhard‚Äù sciences, like physics and chemistry. But inclusion of the term ‚Äúscience‚Äù also seeks to differentiate psychology from its less scientific heritage and past, defend itself from accusations from other scientists / talking heads (if not some of your friends in STEM majors‚Ä¶or parents) that it is not actually REAL SCIENCE ‚Ñ¢.¬†\n\n\nScientific Prediction (and Error)\nAnd so, here we are.

    "text": "Psychology as a REAL SCIENCE ‚Ñ¢\nPsychology desperately wants to establish itself as a real science, like physics and chemistry. You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it, just look at the definitions of some common sources of psychological knowledge - introductory textbooks :¬†¬†\n\n‚ÄúToday, we define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers, 2011)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the science of behavior and the mind.‚Äù (Grey, 2010)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶the scientific study of mind, brain, and behavior.‚Äù (Gazzaniga, 2010)\n‚Äú‚Ä¶We now define psychologyas the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers & DeWall, 2018)\n\nI‚Äôm probably showing my age looking to textbooks, so let‚Äôs check in with ChatGPT to see whether the algorithmic summary of large piles of data suggests that psychology is, in fact, a ‚Äúreal science‚Äù :¬†\n\n\nPerhaps more authoritatively, the American Psychological Association (APA) confirms that psychology is, ‚Äúthe study of the mind and behavior‚Ä¶a diverse scientific discipline comprising several major branches of research.‚Äù (APA, 2024).¬†\nThe consistent emphasis on science (and ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù methods!) in these definitions is an attempt to elevate psychology to the status of other ‚Äúhard‚Äù sciences, like physics and chemistry. But inclusion of the term ‚Äúscience‚Äù also seeks to differentiate psychology from its less scientific heritage and past, defend itself from accusations from other scientists / talking heads (if not some of your friends in STEM majors‚Ä¶or parents) that it is not actually REAL SCIENCE ‚Ñ¢.¬†\n\nWhat is Science? Prediction (and Error)\nAnd so, here we are. In this document, in this required class for the psychology major, learning how to DO REAL SCIENCE. With statistics. Oh yeah, and we‚Äôll also be learning to use this computer programming language called R üòà",

I‚Äôll give you a dataset, and you‚Äôll use your knowledge of statistics, R, and research methods to answer questions about the dataset.\nThe Final Project. You will identify a resarch question that you care about, and then design a study, collect data, analyze the data to answer this question (and write up everything as a scientific research paper.) Wow!\n\nWe will talk much more about these assignments throughout the semester, and you will be well prepared for them if you follow along with the readings, quizzes, and homework assignments each week.",
