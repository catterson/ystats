<p>As y’all know, this class is a requirement for students who want to be psychology majors. This is exciting for me (your professor), and probably some students too. However, over the years I have learned this can be frustrating and stressful for students who wonder <em>why-the-flip</em> they are required to take a math class when all they just want to learn about people (or other non-human animals), ya know!??!</p>
<p>I agree that people (or non-human animals) are interesting. And we all have this interest in people (or non-human animals) because we are complex<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. While people are similar in many ways, we also differ in radical ways; from superficial features like age and race, to more complex ways like our personality or emotions, to highly specific behaviors such as whether all students in the class are reading these words or not, or how bored or excited (or any emotional experience) students are while reading these words.</p>

<p>Statistics is a language that scientists use to describe this complexity. While psychology uses this language to better understand differences in people (or non-human animals), other scientific disciplines focus on their own domains; physicists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in matter and energy, chemists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in elements and compounds, botanists seek to understand differences in plants, and economists seek to understand money.</p>
<p>Like all languages, statistics has vocabulary - words that have shared meaning, and allow us to understand what we are talking about.</p>

<p><strong>A Variable</strong> is a label for some psychological phenomenon that has variation. I’m not sure where I first heard this, but psychologists often focus on what they call the “ABCs”.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>A is for Affect = the emotions that you feel.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>B is for Behavior = the actions that you do.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>C is for cognition = the thoughts you have.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are not rigid categories, and psychologists often debate the definitions of these terms. But they can be useful ways to think about how to think about people, and help break down a complex phenomenon into more specific components.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-language">What’s Language?</h4>
<p>Statisitcs, like spoken languages, is a combination of vocabulary, rules, and culture that people use to communicate with each other.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Vocabulary.</strong> Equations like “the mean” or “standard deviation” or “cronbach’s alpha” or “p-value” are precise vocabulary terms that define some feature of variation. Some of these vocabulary words are easier to understand and remember than others, and like all languages, sometimes people disagree on the definition, and sometimes misuse these words.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grammar and Syntax.</strong> The way we organize words also matters when learning languages. Saying “the professor graded the students“ has a very different meaning than “the students graded the professor”, even though these share the exact same words. Statistics (and research methods) also requires precision in the way we organize the ideas, terms, and processes. We’ll learn more about this as we discuss the scientific method (a highly structured and organized approach to doing research), but also as we learn how to navigate doing data analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cultural Immersion.</strong> A good language class will also help students to understand the ways that the language is connected to people, places, and history<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. In this class, we’ll think about the ways we can immerse ourselves in the culture of statistics and research methods, from the cultural practices that inform which methods or tools to use, to the ways that the culture of statistics and research might needlessly create barriers for certain types of people or studies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Practice and Past Experiences.</strong> And yes, in order to gain fluency in a language, you need to practice! Attendance and regular engagement with this class will ensure that you are able to get the practice that you need. It’s also good to note that people differ in terms of their past experiences with computers and math, and are bringing those experiences (for better or worse) with them into this class.</p></li>

</div></div><p>All psychologists are interested in questions sparked by their own observations or experiences. This is sometimes called “<strong>me-search</strong>” - the idea that a person’s research interests reflect their own experience.</p>
<p>Me-search can be an important way for researchers to use their statistics and research methods training to address questions and issues that are relevant to their lives and communities.</p>

<p>For example, a survey of over 26,000 research articles in psychology documented just how rarely the topic of race is studied.</p>

<p>As we’ll discuss throughout this class, life is complex and there is never one explanation for any phenomenon. However, it’s important to note that psychology as a field has historically been dominated by white authors (researchers who write scientific papers) and white editors (researchers who decide what papers get published or not).</p>

<p>These trends are important to reflect on, because they reveal a bias in who becomes a psychologist, and what types of questions these researchers are interested in pursuing.</p>
<p>It’s also a goal of this class to not only highlight the important contributions of non-white researchers and statisticians, but also make sure that all students in this diverse classroom feels empowered to use statistics, research methods, and R skills to ask (and answer) research questions that matter to them!<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="psychology-as-a-real-science">Psychology as a REAL SCIENCE ™</h3>
<p>Psychology uses statistics because, in part, it wants to establish itself as a real science, like physics and chemistry. You don’t have to take my word for it, just look at the definitions of some common sources of psychological knowledge - introductory textbooks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Today, we define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.” (Myers, 2011)</p></li>
<li><p>“…the science of behavior and the mind.” (Grey, 2010)</p></li>
<li><p>“…the scientific study of mind, brain, and behavior.” (Gazzaniga, 2010)</p></li>
<li><p>“…We now define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.” (Myers &amp; DeWall, 2018)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m probably showing my age looking to textbooks, so let’s check in with ChatGPT<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> to see whether the algorithmic summary of large piles of data suggests that psychology is, in fact, a “real science” :&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps more authoritatively, the American Psychological Association (APA) confirms that psychology is, “the study of the mind and behavior…a diverse scientific discipline comprising several major branches of research.” (APA, 2024).</p>
<p>The consistent emphasis on science (and “rigorous” methods!) in these definitions is an attempt to elevate psychology through language to the status of other “hard” sciences, like physics and chemistry. But inclusion of the term “science” also seeks to differentiate psychology from its less scientific heritage and past, defend itself from accusations from other scientists / talking heads (if not some of your friends in STEM majors…or parents) that it is not actually REAL SCIENCE ™.&nbsp;</p>
<section id="what-is-science-prediction-and-error" class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-science-prediction-and-error">What is Science? Prediction (and Error)</h4>
<p>One of the most important goals of science is to form <strong>predictions</strong>, and then use these predictions in order to influence outcomes (a form of <strong>power</strong>).</p>
<p>A <strong>prediction</strong> is an educated guess you have about the future. Educated means that the guess comes from some knowledge (either your experiences, beliefs, something you learned in a textbook, or the results of a scientific study). A prediction can have two outcomes :</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Valid :</strong> your prediction is right</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Error :</strong> your prediction is wrong.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, things are rarely as simple as “right” or “wrong”, and a large part of this class will be learning how to quantify exactly how much error there is in our scientific predictions.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s look to the stars.</p>
<table class="caption-top table">

I am making this prediction based on the following information :</p>
<ul>

<li><p>I live in Oakland, where it rarely rains in August.</p></li>

<section id="linear-models-to-organize-our-predictions" class="level4 page-columns page-full">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linear-models-to-organize-our-predictions">Linear Models to Organize Our Predictions</h4>
<p>The linear model a simple formula that helps researchers to make, and quantify, their predictions. We will talk much more about linear models in our class - they are one of the most important concepts we will cover and a foundation of modern statistics - but for now let’s just focus on the basics :</p>
<p>A linear model takes the following form: <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn8"><p><sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I can already feel some of y’alls math anxiety rising across time and space. But remember, stats is just a language with some vocabulary we need to learn.</p></div></div><p><span class="math display">\[
DV \sim IV_1 + IV_2 + ... + IV_k + \epsilon
\]</span></p>
<p>Below is a description of terms in the model :</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>DV = dependent variable.</strong> This is the variable that you want to predict. It’s up to the researcher what variable is the dependent variable. More complicated models can have more than one DV, but for this class we will just focus on one DV at a time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>IV = independent variable.</strong> This is a different variable that you think will help you make predictions. Again, it’s up to the researcher to choose what variables they will include to try and make predictions of the DV.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>k = any number.</strong> This is a way of saying that there can be many IVs. Life is complex, and so in order to predict one variable, we will need to use information from lots of other variables.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>~ = a squiggly line / tilde.</strong> I like to use the squiggly line to reinforce the idea that our model is uncertain and squiggly (this is not an exact prediction where an equal sign would be used). R also uses the tilde for defining a model, so it’s nice to start practicing stretching our pinkie finger to reach that upper left corner of the keyboard.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> <strong>= error =</strong> this term always concludes our written model, and accounts for the many other reasons why our predictions might be wrong. This could be because we haven’t included certain variables that are important to make predictions (either because we can’t measure them in our study, don’t think they are important enough to study, or don’t know that we should study them), or because we are measuring our variables with some amount of error<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn9"><p><sup>9</sup>&nbsp;We will learn more about <em>measurement error</em> in Chapter 4.</p></div></div><p>For example, I could write out my prediction about rain as the following linear model :</p>
<ul>
<li>rain ~ clouds + umbrellas + weather app status + smell + air pressure + season + location + temperature + error</li>
</ul>
<p>We read a model as : “the DV is a function of…” or sometimes “the DV depends on…”. So I’d read this model as “rain is a function of clouds, umbrellas, the weather app status…etc.” And it’s good practice to leave the variables neutral (e.g., just “clouds”, not “storm clouds”).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn10"><p><sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Later we will talk about ways to account for the fact that more umbrellas increases the chance it will rain in our model.</p></div></div><p>Error in this model would represent the fact that I haven’t accounted for some important variables that we know we should include (like humidity, coastal pressure systems, or palnetary waves), the fact that some of my variables were probably measured with error (was no one <em>really</em> carrying an umbrella???), and the fact that there are some things that we don’t know about rain, and what predicts it (this is what weather scientists are trying to learn more about.)</p>
<p>Once we add numbers and data to a linear model<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, we can quickly see :</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn11"><p><sup>11</sup>&nbsp;We will get to this in Chapter 6!</p></div></div><ul>
<li><p>which variables allow us to make the best predictions, and which variables do not improve our predictions (e.g., is the number of umbrellas others are carrying a good predictor of whether it’s going to rain or not?)</p></li>
<li><p>the direction of the relationship between each IV and the DV (e.g., is it that more umbrellas = more rain, or more umbrellas = less rain?)</p></li>
<li><p>the amount of error in our predictions (e.g., how good, exactly, is this model at predicting the rain?)</p></li>

I also didn’t add other varibles that might be related to happiness, since these were not part of the researcher’s statement.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-3-how-science-the-scientific-method-in-five-easy-steps">Part 3 : How Science? The Scientific Method in Five Easy Steps</h2>
<p>The Scientific Method is used to help science progress toward valid (accurate, “true”) predictions and avoid biases. This is the same scientific method you may have learned about in a previous science class or used for a science fair project<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>.</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn13"><p><sup>13</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do elementary school students still do those science fair projects with the tri-fold posters? Adult scientists do the same kinds of science fairs, except they are called “conferences”, involve a little more math, and use flat posters. I also don’t think anyone gets ribbons (status among scientists takes other less concrete forms). Some of the largest conferences include that held by the <a href="https://convention.apa.org/">American Psychological Association</a> or the <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/conventions">Association of Psychological Science</a>. The <a href="https://westernpsych.org/convention/">Western Psychological Association</a> has a more local conference, and there are literally hundreds of other conferences based on research topic (for example, the <a href="http://meeting.spsp.org/">Society of Personality and Social Psychology</a>). If you are interested in learning more about conferences, ask your GSI what conferences they attend. And you even might be able to present your project in this class as a conference poster - no tri-fold needed.</p></div></div><p>I like to organize the scientific method into five broad parts, described below.</p>
<section id="step-1-identify-a-question" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-1-identify-a-question">Step 1 : Identify a Question</h3>
<p>First, a researcher starts with a question about the variable that they want to predict or the psychological phenomenon they are interested in. In Part 1 of this chapter, we talked about how these questions are often informed by the researcher’s own observations or experiences. In this section, we’ll discuss ways you can choose a topic to inspire a specific research question - something you will do as part of your final project in this class.</p>
<p>We’ll talk about this more in class, but the basic idea is that you will identify a topic that you care about, develop this idea into a research question, design a study to answer some part of this question, collect and analyze the data from your study (using R!), and then write up the results as an academic paper.</p>
<p>The first step, is picking some topic or variable that you care about, and identifying the parts of your background or experiences that influence this topic. This can be a challenging first step, and it’s okay to struggle. Your topic will also change as we develop it, so don’t feel like it needs to be “perfect” or “locked in” yet.</p>
<p>Looking for project topic inspiration? A few ideas to consider :</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Think about why you become a psychology major.</strong> Was it because you were interested in people, find dreams fascinating, wonder if you could get good at detecting people’s lies? Think about these interests, then think about what variables might be relevant. For example, while you won’t have access to an fMRI machine (or the required statistics) in order to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inaH_i_TjV4">reconstruct images people see during their dreams</a>, you might study people’s beliefs about the importance of their dreams, or the extent to which they have dreams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Focus on a problem you’ve encountered or observed in real-life.</strong> Notice that something in the world could be better? How would you label that as a variable? For example, maybe you want to better understand people’s attitudes about capitalism or racism or housing costs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Look at faculty webpages, and see what they (and / or their graduate students) are studying.</strong> Does anything seem interesting to you? Who looks like they might be cool to work with? What aspects of their research question might you study with this project?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Chase the latest trends of today.</strong> Identify the new hot trend in our capitalist society these days, and then focus your project on that. For example, you could examine how people’s perceptions of HOTNEWTREND are influenced by some aspect of their identity, or how exposure to HOTNEWTREND influences people’s affect, behavior, or cognition (compared to another HOTTREND, or maybe an OLDTREND).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>You don’t have to take my word for it.</strong> <a href="https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/introduction/researchproblem">Here’s another guide</a> that might offer some help, or ask for help in the class discord / office hours / lecture!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you’ve chosen your topic, make sure that it’s the right level of focus, and something you can complete with the resources you have.</p>

<p>Hi folks, Prof.&nbsp;Cat here. I’ll be popping up throughout this book to guide you through the process of working on your final project. To do this, I’ll work on an example along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing a Topic and Reflecting on the Ways Your Background Influences (and maybe biases) You :</strong> I’m interested in the (negative) consequences of looking at images of war-torn cities on people’s attitudes about the inhabitants. Specifically, I’m wondering if seeing these images of destroyed cities - and the screaming or injured citizens who live in them - leads people to (unintentionally) dehumanize these people by seeing them only as powerless victims, and not inhabitants with culture, family structures, etc. This interest is inspired by a few different things - I’ve seen a lot of horrifying images from Gaza in the last few years, but less emphasis or coverage about how these people are (and were) living before being bombed. I also have always been really critical of war and the US war machine as a kid (due to the influence of my parents, some books, Miyazaki films, a few teachers, and a minister). I’m also half-Iranian, so am biased to pay more attention to this part of the world (and the long history of conflict with the US), and probably am biased to see victims from this region in more humanizing ways because of the many cultural similarities (in language, music, dress, religion, love of tea, etc.)</p>

<section id="step-2-develop-a-theory" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-develop-a-theory">Step 2 : Develop a Theory</h3>
<p>A scientific theory is one that is comprehensive, explanatory, and supported by evidence. For example, the theory of evolution is <em>comprehensive</em> (it relates to all nature, not just plants or animals or finches), it is <em>explanatory</em> (it’s why we and <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1227/1227-h/images/fig15.jpg">cats</a> both narrow our eyes when we are scared and angry), and it is <em>supported</em> (by over 100 years of evidence<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>).&nbsp;</p>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn14"><p><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;<a href="https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/0_0_0/lines_01">From fossil records to observations of fruit flies and plans</a></p></div></div><p><strong>Most scientists refrain from saying that a theory is “proven” or “true” for two reasons:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>First, the scientific method is a process - our knowledge and ideas are continually updated. So it’s likely that the theory of evolution will be updated as we learn more about the complex ways genes replicate and interact with the environment. Saying that a theory is “proven” is a common mistake - watch out for it!&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Second, most scientists (and psychologists) draw from Karl Popper’s philosophy of science, which adheres to a requirement for science called <strong>falsifiability -</strong> the ability to find evidence that rejects a theory (“ability to falsify”). This means a theory is never ‘proven’ because scientists are continually looking for evidence to reject the theory. It also means that a belief that cannot be tested or rejected would be rejected as a scientific belief - you have to be able to test your belief in some observable way. Falsifiability is where I think science separates from religious belief - someone with faith doesn’t need evidence, and that’s okay! It just doesn’t make the belief scientific under science’s narrow definition.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hypotheses</strong> are specific predictions that researchers make about what they expect to see in the data if their theory is supported or is not supported by data.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>alternative hypothesis</strong> (sometimes written <strong>HA</strong>) is the researcher’s own belief. It may seem strange to label your belief “alternative” when this word is used for things that are supposed to be different (“alternative rock = it’s not your parent’s rock &amp; roll!”), and we are so used to thinking that our beliefs are the default that to call them alternative seems wrong. This is an example of previous beliefs bias, and the decision to label our beliefs as the “alternative” is an example of science trying to correct this bias. It’s a small and symbolic correction, but it’s better than nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>null hypothesis</strong> (sometimes written <strong>H0</strong>) is the label given for whatever evidence would not support the researcher’s belief.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE :</strong> Let’s say you believe that smoking cannabis hurts a person’s memory. What’s the alternative hypothesis? What’s the null?</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Null Hypothesis :</strong> People who smoke cannabis will perform BETTER or NO DIFFERENT on a memory test than people who do not smoke marijauna. <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis :</strong> People who smoke cannabis will perform WORSE on a memory test than people who do not smoke marijauna.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn15"><p><sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Many students forget to include the “NO DIFFERENT” in the null hypothesis example above. However remember that the null hypothesis is everything that your theory is not. So if your theory is that smoking cannabis HURTS memory, then finding no difference in the memory of pot smokers vs.&nbsp;non-smokers would not support your theory, and is thus part of the null hypothesis. (Note : some of y’all may have missed this because you are remembering learning about “directional” vs “non-directional” hypotheses - we will discuss this more in Lecture 8.)</p></div></div><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdPgseWI3odCwC34jvRZGe0H4oz0Et4HwG8xTig5YFtDU_ldw/viewform?usp=header"><strong>Practice : Identifying Models, Null, and Alternative Hypotheses</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Here’s a quick practice quiz to review identifying models based on research questions and theories, and identifying the null and alternative hypotheses based on a given theory.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-3-collect-data" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3-collect-data">Step 3 : Collect Data</h3>
<p>As described above, scientific theories are supported by evidence called data. How researchers collect data is something we will discuss in more detail over the next few weeks. In general, researchers have to figure out how to measure the variables they are interested in studying (e.g., “how will I know if someone is happy or not?”), and then find participants (people or animals) to study (e.g., “whose happiness should I study”).&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, in our smoking cannabis example the decisions about how to measure memory (a music memory game or a word recognition task?) or how much cannabis (a little or a lot?) or who to study (Berkeley students or your grandparents?) in the study would likely influence the results.</p>
<p>The decisions that researchers make about how to define their measures and the participants they will study are very important, and will influence the results of the study (and thus our knowledge of the topic), so stay tuned for more discussion!</p>
</section>
<section id="step-4-use-data-to-test-theories" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-4-use-data-to-test-theories">Step 4 : Use Data to Test Theories</h3>
<p>Finally, researchers look to see if the data they collected supports or rejects their theory (and evaluate how strongly their theory is supported or rejected). We’ll talk much more about using data to test theories this semester.</p>
<p>In our smoking cannabis example, the researcher would look to see which group did better on the memory test, and if the smokers did worse, then their theory would be supported (by this one study, at least).</p>
</section>
<section id="step-5-repeat" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-5-repeat">Step 5 : Repeat</h3>
<p>Once a study is completed, researchers repeat the scientific method in two different ways.</p>
<p>Researchers will sometimes repeat the exact same steps a second time - something called <strong>replication</strong>. Replication is critical to science.</p>
<p>Scientists also repeat the scientific method with a new question that is based on the results from their first study. Science is a process, and researchers are never done learning about how to better predict &amp; control the world. There’s always more research to do. For example, after identifying a pattern between smoking cannabis and memory, a researcher might ask whether the type or dosage of cannabis intake would influence memory, whether abstinence could reverse the effects of memory impairment, or whether cannabis and coffee together might lead to a different result. Note that this is not an example of replication, since researchers are not testing the same question they had - but it’s repeating the scientific method for a new question inspired by the old. This is good, and part of scientific progress. But the problem is that the incentives for scientific publication focused almost entirely on “new” research, and not really making sure that the “old” research was valid.</p>

<section id="its-never-actually-easy" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="its-never-actually-easy">It’s Never Actually Easy</h3>
<p>Science is hard, and people are very complex, which makes psychological science very hard. Unfortunately, psychology is in a bit of a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics">Replication Crisis</a>. This crisis is two-fold a) researchers tend not to seek to replicate their (or others’) results, and b) systematic attempts to do so have suggested that the majority of results in psychology do not replicate<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>
