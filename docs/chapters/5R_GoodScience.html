<p>In this chapter, you’ll learn how psychologists (and scientists) construct and share their knowledge.</p>

<h1>Part 1. The “Normal” Distribution.</h1>
<section id="definition." class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="definition.">Definition.</h2>
<p>The “Normal” (or Gaussian) distribution is a common shape for what distributions of data look like. The shape is often called a “bell curve”, because it looks like the curve of a bell.</p>
<p>While many distributions appear normal, the “Normal Distribution” ™ refers to a distribution that describes an expected probability of a range of scores.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="images/3_NormalDistributionAnnotated.png" class="img-fluid quarto-figure quarto-figure-center figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The Normal Distribution is called “normal” because researchers expect to see this type of distribution for variables where two conditions are met:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>There are multiple explanations for why the variation occurs</strong>. This happens very frequently across all science, since life is complex and there are many reasons why individuals differ.</li>
<li><strong>These multiple explanations occur randomly</strong>. This means that the multiple explanations for variation are mostly independent of one another, and there is not some shared experience among individuals that is influencing their variation.</li>
</ol>
<section id="example-thinking-about-distributions" class="level3 page-columns page-full">

<p><strong>“Random” explanations for why variation in self-esteem occurs.</strong> Self-esteem is complex, and can be influenced by variables such as: genetics, parental environment, home environment, income, neurotransmitters, whether your crush told you they like you too the day you took the self-esteem survey, etc. These variables are considered random because one does not influence the other, and they differ across participants in the study. That is, someone who had a happy parental environment may not necessarily have a high income.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“Non-Random” Explanations.</strong> Careful observers will note that self-esteem appears slightly shifted above the mid-point of the scale (which goes from 1-4, so 2.5 would be the mid-point), and that there’s some slight negative skew (meaning more individuals are on the higher end of the distribution). This shift is likely the result of some shared cultural experiences among participants - our society values self-esteem, and people might be biased to self-enhance / self-present a higher self-esteem. This is a non-random influence, since many participants might experience this.</p>

<p>These data are not normally distributed because the students were all part of the same college, in the same classroom, taught by the same professor, at the same time.

<td>That’s right folks, it’s time for another chat with your friend Open-Source Mickey Mouse! This time, we’re gonna chat about the idea that people differ from some average. The idea that you could quantify people as “average” is fairly new - it’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but a scientist named Quetelet first extended the statistical methods derived from astronomy to be applied to humans in the 1860s<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. Quetelet thought the average was an ideal state since it reflected the center of all possible individuals. However, a few years later Francis Galton used Quetelet’s ideas to try and “rank” individuals according to some hierarchy of excellence. For Galton, the average was not an ideal state, but rather something to overcome in a desire for greater and greater excellence. Galton was also a racist and father of the eugenics movement, who used distorted statistics as a tool to justify his own pre-existing racist beliefs that white people were superior to everyone else.</td>

<p>But you don’t have to take it from me! Here’s Galton in his own words :</p>
<p><em>To conclude, the range of mental power between—I will not say the highest Caucasian and the lowest savage—but between the greatest and least of English intellects, is enormous. … I propose in this chapter to range men according to their natural abilities, putting them into classes separated by equal degrees of merit, and to show the relative number of individuals included in the several classes…..The method I shall employ for discovering all this, is an application of the very curious theoretical law of “deviation from an average.” First, I will explain the law, and then I will show that the production of natural intellectual gifts comes justly within its scope. -</em> Galton, Hereditary Genius (1869). <a href="https://galton.org/books/hereditary-genius/text/v5/galton-1869-hereditary-genius-v5.htm">Linked here</a>.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;see Rose’s END OF AVERAGE (2016) or, for a more critical approach, Chapman’s (2023) EMPIRE OF NORMALITY.</p></div></div><p>The point of bringing up some of the racist origins of statistics is two-fold :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Many people like to argue that “good” statistics is objective, and that scientists are free of bias. So it’s important to acknowledge that the inventors of many statistics that we use had clear biases and did not behave objectively. Rather than try to be free of bias, I think it’s important to acknowledge where and when people are biased, and address those biases up explicitly.</li>
<li>Statistics is a tool, and that tool can be used poorly and dangerously in ways that can cause a lot of pain. Just because something has numbers doens’t mean it’s correct. For example, Galton’s work showing “statistically” that white people were superior in ability to other groups didn’t account for other factors like socioeconomic status. And for what it’s worth, modern scientists overwhelmingly agree that “race” is a social construct. There are genetic differences that explain different skin tones, however there is more genetic variation in skin tone within a similar “race” than between different “races”. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/genetic-study-shows-skin-color-just-skin-deep-180965261/">Read more about this here.</a></li>

<p>The normal distribution is foundational to the statistics we will learn in this class. (And in an advanced statistics class, you’ll learn how to adapt techniques if you want to understand non-normal distributions.)</p>
<p>This does not mean that every variable needs to be normally distributed; we’ll work with skewed variables and categorical variables (which have their own distributions) in lots of ways. However, the “normal distribution” is an important reference point that we can use to evaluate variables. For example, exam scores are <em>negatively skewed</em> because they differ from the normal distribution.</p>

<section id="part-2.-good-data" class="level1 page-columns page-full">
<h1>Part 2. Good Data</h1>
<p>Scientists evaluate the quality of their measures in terms of <strong>validity</strong> (“truth” or accuracy) and <strong>reliability</strong> (repeatability or precision). Learn more about these two concepts - and their specific forms - in the two videos below.</p>
<section id="specific-forms-of-validity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="specific-forms-of-validity">Specific Forms of Validity</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Face Validity:</strong> asks us to evaluate whether our measure or result look like what it should look like. This is a superficial (and somewhat subjective) judgment. But it is often a powerful and quick way to assess. For example, if I measure my height and it tells me 100 feet, I know something is wrong because there is no way I’m that tall. Or, when looking at a self-esteem measure, I would want to see items that look like self-esteem questions (“I feel good about myself”.) If the self-esteem measure had other questions in it that didn’t really seem like they were measuring self-esteem (“I like to look at myself in the mirror”) I would have questions about the face-validity of the measure. This seems super obvious, but it’s an important check - do the measures used actually look like what they should?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Convergent validity:</strong> asks us to evaluate whether our measure similar to related concepts. When two things converge, they come together, and we want our measure to be similar to things that it should be similar to. For example, a measure of body height should be related to a measure of shoe size or tibia length. A measure of self-esteem should be similar to a measure of self-efficacy or satisfaction with life, since both are about how the person is subjectively seeing themselves. They shouldn’t be exactly the same thing, but we’d expect to see a pattern in the data. (We’ll talk more about how to quantify these patterns when we learn more about linear models.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discriminant validity:</strong> asks about whether our measure is different from unrelated concepts. When two things diverge, they are different from one another. And we WANT our measure to be different from things that we expect them to be different from. For example, a measure of height should be different from a measure of reading speed or how organized a person is. We would expect self-esteem to be different from how social a person is (though maybe there’s some relationship since our society values sociability, and people who are social might get more positive messages from others, bolstering their self-esteem.) This is the hardest concept for students to get, but it’s a really important test of the validity of a measure. I not only want my measure to be related to concepts it should be related to, but also different from concepts it should be different from.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="reliability" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reliability">Reliability</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Test-retest reliability:</strong> asks us to evaluate whether we get the same result if we take multiple measures separated by time. If I think of self-esteem as a stable trait, I should expect to see some similarity in a person’s self-esteem at one time point and then the next day. Of course, there will be some change - self-esteem (and other personality variables) can be influenced by the situation and environment. But they shouldn’t be radically different if we have a good measure of this core aspect of the self.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inter-rater / Inter-judge reliability:</strong> asks us to evalute whether multiple observers (or tools) make similar measurements. If I have two rulers made by the same company, I would expect them to give me similar answers for how tall I am. Similarly, two different observers who are reliable should make similar jugments about a person’s self-esteem, or the number of interruptions they count. If our measure is not reliable, then we might get different answers from the different people (or tools) making the measurement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inter-item reliability:</strong> When we learned about likert scales, we learned about Cronbach’s Alpha - a method of assessing how much the different items in a likert scale were related to each other. This is a form of reliability - specific only to likert scales where we have different questions that are all measuring the same thing. If the scale is reliable, we expect to get similar answers across the different items. For example, someone who says “I feel good about myself” should also say “I feel that I have a number of good qualities.”</p></li>

<h1>Part 3. Good Research for Fun and Profit</h1>
<p>Researchers share their knowledge with others in <strong>scientific articles</strong>. These are written by researchers for other researchers, tend to be very detailed and technical, and are a researcher’s golden ticket to getting a job, research grant, invited talk or book deal, podcast invitation, etc. So there’s a lot of pressure to publish research among academics.&nbsp;</p>
<section id="the-publication-process" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-publication-process">The Publication Process</h2>
<p>Researchers spread their scientific knowledge by publishing research papers. You can read more about how researchers publish research HERE. However, the TLDR is something like this :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Researcher has an idea!</strong> They assemble a team of others interested in the idea, and do a literature review in order to gain background knowledge on the topic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Researcher designs a study, collects data, analyzes the data, and writes up the data as a report.</strong> All the steps of the scientific method. This is what you will do for the final project!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Researcher submits the report to a scientific journal.</strong> A journal is a collection of articles that are usually united by some common theme. In general, the shorter the name of the journal, the more prestigious<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. For example, the “Journal of Research in Personality” is considered less prestigious than the “Journal of Personality and Social Psychology”, which is less prestigious than the journal called “Psychological Science”, which is considered less prestigious than the journal called “Science”.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An editor decides whether to review or reject the article.</strong> Editors make an initial decision - based on a summary of the study and a letter that the author writes to the editor - whether the research article might be a good fit for the journal. If so, they pass it along to the next step. If not, they send a “Thanks, but….” rejection letter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The editor sends the article to peer-reviewers.</strong> Peer reviewers are other researchers who have some related research interests or skills in the topic of the paper. They will look over the article. The editor may know these people, or they get asked by another peer-reviewer who didn’t want to do it but nominated someone else to step into the role. Peer-reviewers work on a completely voluntary basis - it’s seen as required service, and there’s a bit of professional reputation to maintain in doing this work. Yes, there are problems with unpaid labor in academia. We can chat about that if you’d like; ask questions / raise it as an issue on Discord.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The editor makes a decision on the paper based on the feedback from the peer-reviewers.</strong> The editor summarizes the feedback, and either accepts the paper, accepts as long as the person makes necessary revisions, asks the researcher to “Revise and Resubmit” (this is called an R&amp;R - probably the most common outcome, and does not guarantee that the paper will be accepted if the revisions are made, but will get sent out to peer-reviewers again), or rejects the paper. In any case, the author will see the comments made by the peer-reviewers and the editor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The (accepted) paper goes to a proofreader and is published.</strong> Hooray! This process probably takes anywhere from 6 months (insanely fast) to 2 years (or more, depending on the number of revisions that are required).</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div id="fn5"><p><sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Prestige is a very subjective concept in science. However, scientists have found many ways to quantify it, as described in the sections below!</p>

<section id="publish-or-perish" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="publish-or-perish">Publish! Or Perish…?</h2>
<p>Ask any grad student or professor - the publication process is stressful, unpredictable, slow, and threatening. Grad students are required to publish papers in order to have a chance at an academic job as a researcher (and even extremely productive and thoughtful graduate students are not guaranteed an academic job), professors are required to publish papers in order to get a chance of getting tenure (and even extremely productive and thoughtful researchers are not guaranteed tenure).</p>
<p>This creates incredible pressure on researchers to get results; pressure that often can interfere with people’s ability to do GOOD science. We’ll talk about this more throughout the semester; bring questions to class / Discord!</p>

This means the researchers did something “new” - usually they collected and analyzed new data to test a theory, or analyzed existing data in a new way. Here’s an example of an original report on the topic of emotion regulation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replication :</strong> A replication is a type of study where a researcher repeats the steps they (or another) researcher did, and sees if they get the same result. As we discussed, psychology (and many other fields) is in a <strong>replication crisis.</strong> This type of article was not very common before the 2010s, but is more common now. Still, faculty tend to be biased toward producing original reports - a school like Berkeley or Stanford would not hire a researcher just for doing replications. Here’s an example of a replication on the topic of emotion regulation. Note this is not really a direct replication, since they replicated in a different population.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Meta-Analyses :</strong> A meta-analysis is where researchers take other people’s data, collect it, and analyze it in order to see broad trends across an entire field. For example, a meta-analysis might take all the research on whether there’s a relationship between playing violent video games and violent behavior, and analyze this existing research in terms of common themes, such as the type of video games the researchers studied, the measures of violence, and the results. Meta-Analyses can be a great way to look at a broad trend, but they rely on the assumption that the individual studies they summarize are, in fact, valid themselves. That is, if there are systematic biases in the way researchers study a topic, the Meta Analysis won’t solve or even identify those problems. Here’s an example of a meta-analysis done on the topic of emotion regulation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review Article :</strong> Review articles summarize existing research without doing any additional data analysis (in contrast to a Meta-Analysis, in which there is data analysis of past research). This is the closest thing to a paper you might write in an English class - the authors take past research, summarize it in terms of common themes, and maybe highlight limitations, or new directions the field might take. Review articles are a great way to get a broad overview of a topic, since they summarize and organize past research, and will often highlight next steps that researchers should take. Here’s an example of a review article done on the topic of emotion regulation.</p></li>

<section id="the-peer-review-process" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-peer-review-process">The Peer Review Process</h2>
<p>In order to publish their results, researchers have their peers review their work, and provide comments or suggestions. The peer-review process ideally serves two purposes :&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Peer Reviewers Help Improve the Research.</strong> The peers doing the reviewing are supposed to have expertise in the topic of the paper. This allows them to suggest ways to improve the paper. These suggestions can run from the simple (such as recommending other researchers to reference in the introduction or additional analyses to run) to very involved (suggestions for additional studies to run, different methods to use, or different people to study).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Peer Reviewers Provide a Vote of Confidence in the Ideas and Analyses of the Paper.</strong> The editor of a journal will look to the peer reviewers for evidence that the research is “high quality” and / or novel enough to be published. There’s a fair amount of bias here - some reviewers think the research is good but not considered a “good fit” for the journal. But the “peer-reviewed” label of a journal gives at least one layer of confidence that some other people like this research.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>One important aspect of the peer-review process is that the peer-reviewers are anonymous to the author, and sometimes the author is anonymous to the peer-reviewers. Ideally, this helps prevent previous beliefs bias (since some researchers may have positive or negative impressions of each other) and social influence bias (since a famous researcher at a fancy school may have their research more trusted than someone with less prestige to their name or institution). However, psychological fields are often small enough that people tend to know who’s doing what research, and there are other cues that can tip peer-reviewers off about who the author of a study is (for example, the author of a study will likely reference their own work, since their new study builds off their old study.)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-research-articles">Finding Research Articles</h2>
<p>Next week we will find research articles related to YOUR research interests. I like to use Google Scholar for this - I find the search features powerful and Google will comb the internet for free versions of research articles (so I don’t have to be on campus or have proxy access to UC Berkeley’s library or “steal” articles from publishers using sci-hub).</p>
<p>For example, searching for one of my dissertation chapters shows <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=situational+suppression&amp;btnG=">this page</a>.</p>

<section id="how-to-find-articles" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-find-articles"><strong>How to Find Articles</strong></h3>
<p>Some tips for finding an article related to your topic :&nbsp;</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Use the right “jargon”.</strong> As part of the operationalization process, scientists use specialized terms. What you might call “holding it in” researchers call “expressive suppression”; a “jerk” would be someone “low in agreeableness”; that feeling of “being hella stressed before an exam but also low key stepping up because of that stress” is the “psychophysiological distinction between challenge and threat”. As you search for research related to your topic, take note of how researchers are describing related phenomena, and adjust your terms as needed. This is part of building your schema for the topic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Look at past research on the topic.</strong> If you’ve found a relevant article on your topic, it’s likely that the article has referenced other research that is also relevant. Read or scan through the introduction (or the references section) and see if there’s something that looks related to your interests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Look at future research on the topic.</strong> If you found a relevant article on your topic, it’s likely that other researchers have also read that article, and used it in their future research. Google Scholar has a “Cited By” button [<img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdWGVqSlFveQI-XwiVPiF5OVZfqTJ6ZVpbWoZ4d6eyX-vZsyT3FIds-nNl45tG3S27HzsIfnY5wTXOlGFuOUApLFAMv_gV26IYmMs8fK19bnTlcvPg3VyPAhpz2mM1si-r--9McWxuobdjof6KyiJ0TjZA_?key=1Qk4xdWCPgEH5SdUQ-Oz2w.png" width="40" height="13">]that you can use in order to see more recent articles that have referenced the article you found. This is a particularly useful way to find more recent research if you found a “classic” in the field, or check for replications or controversies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Old Research is Okay! But look for new research too.</strong> Many students wonder if an “old” study is still relevant. Some papers are “classics” in the field, and great to read. But it’s likely that our field’s understanding of self-esteem has changed from 1970. If you are hoping to build your schema on a topic, finding a review article from the last 10 years (or 5; or 2!) would be a good place to start.</p></li>
</ol>

<section id="how-to-evaluate-an-article" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-to-evaluate-an-article">How to Evaluate an Article</h3>
<p>It can often be overwhelming for students to sift through the masses of research on a topic and know what’s most important and relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reading the article and using your critical thinking skills / psychological training is the best approach. To do this, it is recommended to <strong>go to Graduate School,</strong> where you canspend multiple years reading as much as you want on a beautiful college campus, taking classes where you can deeply engage with the research and ideas, immerse yourself in meaningful intellectual conversations had by other graduate students and kindly professors - the gleam of knowledge and excitement of supporting the next generation of researcher in their eye. Oh, that is not interesting to you / grad schools are flooded with applications / you can’t get an office hour appointment with your professor who actually / you don’t have the privilege of spending 5-8 years getting paid near-poverty wages to be a poor scholar?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, below are a few other ideas to make superficial , all depending on our good friend social influence bias :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The Citation Count.</strong> Google scholar allows you to see how many other research articles have referenced the article that you found. While this can be a nice way to see how influential a paper is, a paper could be referenced a lot for reasons other than its validity, and maybe no one has read the most amazing paper in the world.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Impact Factor of the Journal.</strong> Journals have different “prestige factors”, and the impact factor is one way to quantify this prestige. Impact factor is usually defined as the number of times the average article in a journal has been referenced by other researchers in a year. So an impact factor of 2 means that each article in that journal is referenced by two other articles in a year. The impact factor is something you have to look up - journals usually track this. I wouldn’t spend too much time worrying about it, but it’s a quick way to get a very superficial sense of the journal’s reputation. For example, let’s see how the impact factor relates to our rule of “broader journal name = more prestige”.</p></li>

<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>The Researcher and Institution.</strong> Another way to evaluate an article is by evaluating the author. Does it look like this research has produced other cool research, or do you find their work boring and problematic for some reason? Is this researcher well known and respected in the field? Do they seem to have a happy photo with all their graduate students on their lab website, or is their lab website 10 years old and just has one sad looking graduate student asking for help with their eyes? Has the researcher continued to produce interesting, reliable research? Or were they the subject of a replication scandal?</li>
