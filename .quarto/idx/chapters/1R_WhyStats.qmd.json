This is exciting for me (your professor), and probably some students too. However, over the years I have learned this can be frustrating and stressful for students who wonder *why-the-flip* they are required to take a math class when all they just want to learn about people (or other non-human animals), ya know!??!\n\nI agree that people (or non-human animals) are interesting. And we all have this interest in people (or non-human animals) because we are complex[^1r_whystats-1]. While people are similar in many ways, we also differ in radical ways; from superficial features like age and race, to more complex ways like our personality or emotions, to highly specific behaviors such as whether all students in the class are reading these words or not, or how bored or excited (or any emotional experience) students are while reading these words.\n\n[^1r_whystats-1]: ¬†One of the reasons I love teaching in the Bay Area is y‚Äôall are hella complex.\n\nI hope that you have an interest in people (or non-human animals), and that this class helps you learn how to think about those interests through a psychological, and statistical lens. You don't always need this lens - and as we will discuss there can sometimes be dangers in viewing people through this lens - but it's useful to be able to wear these \"glasses\" when needed.\n\n### Statistics as a Language\n\nStatistics is a language that scientists use to describe this complexity. While psychology uses this language to better understand differences in people (or non-human animals), other scientific disciplines focus on their own domains; physicists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in matter and energy, chemists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in elements and compounds, botanists seek to understand differences in plants, and economists seek to understand money.\n\n#### Variables and Variation\n\nVariation is at the heart of statistics, and is defined by differences, change, and complexity.\n\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Between-Person Variation** describes how individuals differ from each other. Think about ways that you differ from others; not everybody wears glasses, has the same level of silliness / seriousness / desire to cause mischief / fascination with horses.                                                                                                                                                             | ![](/images/1_between_belcher_variation.webp){fig-alt=\"five characters who are family members of the the TV show bob‚Äôs burgers expressing a variety of emotions and striking different poses.\" fig-align=\"center\"} |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Within-Person Variation** describes how one individual changes over time or across different situations. Think about the person you are today - are you exactly the same as you were yesterday? A year ago? You‚Äôve changed (varied) in ways both small (hunger, exhaustion, number of words you‚Äôve read for this class) and large (personality, love interests, identity, etc.)                                         | ![](images/clipboard-3637432840.png)                                                                                                                                                                               |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **No variation** would describe a situation in which everyone is exactly the same. I can‚Äôt think of too many situations where there is no variation; let me know on Discord if you can think of one? And while there‚Äôs no theoretical limit to the amount of variation that there can be, one major task of this class will be to learn to quantify the amount of variation that we observe in our role as psychologists. | ::: {style=\"font-size:300%;\"}                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | üåûüåûüåû                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | üåûüåûüåû                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | :::                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n**A Variable** is a label for some psychological phenomenon that has variation. I'm not sure where I first heard this, but psychologists often focus on what they call the ‚ÄúABCs‚Äù.¬†\n\n-   **A is for Affect = the emotions that you feel.**\n\n-   **B is for Behavior = the actions that you do.**\n\n-   **C is for cognition = the thoughts you have.**\n\nThese are not rigid categories, and psychologists often debate the definitions of these terms. But they can be useful ways to think about how to think about people, and help break down a complex phenomenon into more specific components.\n\n#### Practice : Variables and Variation\n\nFor example, think about how affect, behavior, and cognition might be relevant if I ask you to think about an upcoming exam (your first exam is in just a few weeks!)¬†\n\n+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|                       | **highlight the cells below to see my ideas / check your understanding**                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Affect Example**    | [the feeling of anxiety or dread you have thinking about being assessed, or maybe a feeling of excitement about the opportunity to demonstrate your hard work / effort / knowledge!]{style=\"color:white\"}                                                                         |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Behavior Example**  | [immediately checking your calendar to see when exams are; or maybe avoiding your classes with a nice procrastination session on the ol‚Äô infinite scroll machine.]{style=\"color:white\"}                                                                                           |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Cognition Example** | [thinking about all the work you have to do; wondering why the professor would choose this example when he could have thought about the ways that affect, behavior, and cognition would be triggered when you see a puppy or kitten or something like that‚Ä¶]{style=\"color:white\"} |\n+-----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n*(Here's [a cat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am3NVGP9rkQ) I like for students needing a distraction from thinking about exams. I promise your exams in this class will be chill and I'll do my best to prepare y'all.)*\n\n#### Language is More than Vocabulary\n\nStatistics is a language that scientists use to describe this complexity. While psychology uses this language to better understand variation in people (or non-human animals), other scientific disciplines focus on their own domains; physicists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in matter and energy, chemists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in elements and compounds, botanists seek to understand differences in plants, and economists seek to understand money.\n\n-   **Vocabulary.** Equations like \"the mean\" or ‚Äústandard deviation‚Äù or \"cronbach's alpha\" or \"p-value\" are precise vocabulary terms that define some feature of variation. Some of these vocabulary words are easier to understand and remember than others, and like all languages, sometimes people disagree on the definition, and sometimes misuse these words.\n\n-   **Grammar and Syntax.** The way we organize words also matters when learning languages. Saying ‚Äúthe professor graded the students‚Äú has a very different meaning than ‚Äúthe students graded the professor‚Äù, even though these share the exact same words. Statistics (and research methods) also requires precision in the way we organize the ideas, terms, and processes. We‚Äôll learn more about this as we discuss the scientific method (a highly structured and organized approach to doing research), but also as we learn how to navigate doing data analysis.\n\n-   **Cultural Immersion.** A good language class will also help students to understand the ways that the language is connected to people, places, and history[^1r_whystats-2]. In this class, we‚Äôll think about the ways we can immerse ourselves in the culture of statistics and research methods, from the cultural practices that inform which methods or tools to use, to the ways that the culture of statistics and research might needlessly create barriers for certain types of people or studies.\n\n-   **Practice and Past Experiences.** And yes, in order to gain fluency in a language, you need to practice! Attendance and regular engagement with this class will ensure that you are able to get the practice that you need. It‚Äôs also good to note that people differ in terms of their past experiences with computers and math, and are bringing those experiences (for better or worse) with them into this class.\n\n[^1r_whystats-2]: And usually food, though I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs cultural food norms about statistics or research methods.\n\n### Culture in Statistics : Me-Search\n\n+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| ![](/images/doff_intro_mickey.png){width=\"156\"} | Hiya folks! Everyone's favorite Open-Source Mickey Mouse here. I'll be popping up in the book from time to time to critically engage with the idea that statistics has a culture that is socially constructed by people like you! |\n+-------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nAll psychologists are interested in questions sparked by their own observations or experiences. This is sometimes called ‚Äú**me-search**\" - the idea that a person‚Äôs research interests reflect their own experience.\n\nMe-search can be an important way for researchers to use their statistics and research methods training to address questions and issues that are relevant to their lives and communities.\n\nBelow are a few examples of research questions that are related to a person's real-life experiences.\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| **Real Life Experience**                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Research Question**                                                |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| A researcher develops vision problems due to his studies of light, and had to live in a completely darkened room, where he became completely isolated from most of reality.[^1r_whystats-3]                                                            | Does reality exist, or can it only be known through our perceptions? |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| A black graduate student at the University of Chicago realizes that white people cross the street to avoid him, and finds himself whistling classical music to signal that he does not fit their negative stereotypes of a black male.[^1r_whystats-4] | How do people respond and react to others' negative stereotypes?     |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[^1r_whystats-3]: This happened to [Gustav Fechner](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fechner/), one of the early psychologists who pioneered the study of psychophysics, which tested theories that our perceptions do not always match reality (seen in many examples, such as [the dress](https://www.rit.edu/news/color-scientists-explain-dress-went-viral)). FWIW I see it as blue and black.\n\n[^1r_whystats-4]: This anecdote ([as reported here](https://www.npr.org/2010/04/12/125859207/whistling-vivaldi-and-beating-stereotypes)) inspired Claude Steele's research on [stereotype threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat).\n\nHowever, me-search also serves as a form of potential bias in research - not only will a researcher‚Äôs own biases and beliefs influence the way they conduct research, but the types of questions that are asked will be influenced by the types of people doing research.\n\nFor example, a survey of over 26,000 research articles in psychology documented just how rarely the topic of race is studied in psychology (see figure below).\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcVeRkeyopHr-fIf1GEbZvvJ43O5WIDwiLliJScqciZchFXI1qx_pC4bVWEw-YiH36qKMj92OdJ2UM_mqTZ19zsTXM_USpdzhq8CFZVLTsvz-OjcvgAAavKgwMpdSmOyOmvy9eTOiTB2lvFimUNrSEfQJ4?key=50DP3FSRPDJE9FbjhZ_85g){fig-alt=\"a graph that illustrates how much research on race is published in three different types of psychology journals. the proportion of publications on the y-axis, and the decade on the x-axis. the graph shows that over time, the percentage of publications that highlight race has stayed at zero for cognitive psychology, slightly increased from around 5% for developmental and social psychology (in the 1970s) to 10% for developmental psychology in the 2010s and 8% in social psychology in the 2010s.\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"475\"}\n\nAs we'll discuss throughout this class, life is complex and there is never one explanation for any phenomenon. However, it's important to note that psychology as a field has historically been dominated by white authors (researchers who write scientific papers) and white editors (researchers who decide what papers get published or not).\n\n![](/images/1_white_authors.png){fig-alt=\"another graph that illustrates the percentage of journal articles that were written by authors who were white or persons of color over the last 4 decades.\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"475\"}\n\nThese trends are important to reflect on, because they reveal a bias in who becomes a psychologist, and what types of questions these researchers are interested in pursuing.\n\nIt's also a goal of this class to not only highlight the important contributions of non-white researchers and statisticians, but also make sure that all students in this diverse classroom feels empowered to use statistics, research methods, and R skills to ask (and answer) research questions that matter to them![^1r_whystats-5]\n\n[^1r_whystats-5]: This is the purpose of your final project! We'll talk more about this throughout the class.\n\n## Psychology as a REAL SCIENCE ‚Ñ¢\n\nPsychology desperately wants to establish itself as a real science, like physics and chemistry. You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it, just look at the definitions of some common sources of psychological knowledge - introductory textbooks :¬†¬†\n\n-   ‚ÄúToday, we define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers, 2011)\n\n-   ‚Äú...the science of behavior and the mind.‚Äù (Grey, 2010)\n\n-   ‚Äú...the scientific study of mind, brain, and behavior.‚Äù (Gazzaniga, 2010)\n\n-   ‚Äú...We now define psychology as the science of behavior and mental processes.‚Äù (Myers & DeWall, 2018)\n\nI‚Äôm probably showing my age looking to textbooks, so let‚Äôs check in with ChatGPT[^1r_whystats-6] to see whether the algorithmic summary of large piles of data suggests that psychology is, in fact, a ‚Äúreal science‚Äù :¬†\n\n[^1r_whystats-6]: See the syllabus for the course ChatGPT policy. You may also be interested to read on the ethical and [environmental issues](https://bsj.studentorg.berkeley.edu/the-new-dimension-to-the-climate-crisis-chat-gpt/) surrounding this emerging technology.\n\n![](/images/1_psychsci_chatGPT_def.png){width=\"475\"}\\\n\nPerhaps more authoritatively, the American Psychological Association (APA) confirms that psychology is, ‚Äúthe study of the mind and behavior‚Ä¶a diverse scientific discipline comprising several major branches of research.‚Äù (APA, 2024).¬†\n\nThe consistent emphasis on science (and ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù methods!) in these definitions is an attempt to elevate psychology to the status of other ‚Äúhard‚Äù sciences, like physics and chemistry. But inclusion of the term ‚Äúscience‚Äù also seeks to differentiate psychology from its less scientific heritage and past, defend itself from accusations from other scientists / talking heads (if not some of your friends in STEM majors‚Ä¶or parents) that it is not actually REAL SCIENCE ‚Ñ¢.¬†\n\n### What is Science? Prediction (and Error)\n\nOne of the most important goals of science is to form **predictions**, and then use these predictions in order to influence outcomes (a form of **power**).\n\nA **prediction** is an educated guess you have about the future. Educated means that the guess comes from some knowledge (either your experiences, beliefs, something you learned in a textbook, or the results of a scientific study). A prediction can have two outcomes :\n\n-   **Valid :** your prediction is right\n\n-   **Error :** your prediction is wrong.\n\nOf course, things are rarely as simple as \"right\" or \"wrong\", and a large part of this class will be learning how to quantify exactly how much error there is in our scientific predictions.\n\nAs an example, let's look to the stars.\n\n+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| ![](images/clipboard-3451448147.png) | Astronomers have developed knowledge about celestial bodies - gravity, orbits, mass (I know very little about this).                                                               |\n|                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                      | But I trust this science because astronomers are able to use it to make very valid predictions about giant space rocks and when they will come close to the earth.[^1r_whystats-7] |\n|                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                      | I can use this knowledge to plan a stargazing trip, or plan to watch all the rich people leave earth when the \"big one\" comes for the rest of us.                                  |\n+--------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n[^1r_whystats-7]: You can see when scientists predict Halley's comet to come closest to earth [here](https://theskylive.com/halley-tracker). While this is fairly accurate, I've seen the exact prediction change over the years - there is still some error in this prediction.\n\nFor our first lecture, start thinking of some predictions that you have made today. What knowledge informed the prediction. Did you use this prediction to influence your future behavior in some way? What kinds of predictions do psychologists make? We will chat more about these ideas in class :) but it's a core focus on why psychologists use predictions.\n\nAnd so, here we are. In this document, in this required class for the psychology major, learning how to DO REAL SCIENCE. With statistics. So Oh yeah, and we‚Äôll also be learning to use this computer programming language called R [üòà](https://emojipedia.org/smiling-face-with-horns)\n\n## Why R?\n\nThis semester, we will also learn how to use the computer programming language R to work with data, conduct analyses, and make graphs. R can be intimidating to work with at first, and is more confusing than it needs to be sometimes (as you‚Äôll quickly find out haha), but I promise you will learn! In fact, that‚Äôs the point of this class. It‚Äôs totally okay (and expected) for you to feel frustrated at times; this is part of the learning process. So please embrace the ‚ÄúI HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I‚ÄôM DOING‚Äù dog meme energy (and look how happy the doggy looks!) as you embark on your R journey.\\\n\n+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------+\n| ![](images/R_logo.svg.png){width=\"275\"} | ![](images/r_meme_dog.png)     |\n+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------+\n\n### Installing R\n\n[**Use this link to Download and Install the Programs R and RStudio Desktop**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)\n\n[**Note : You must download both R and RStudio Desktop (these are two separate programs). Make sure to download the most recent version of R and RStudio to avoid issues in the future.**]{style=\"color:red\"}\n\n1.  **R** is the powerful, free, and somewhat intimidating computer program that we will use to analyze data in this class. This website is not super friendly - choose the operating system you have (Windows, MacOS, or Linux) and then download the ‚Äúlatest release‚Äù on the next page. **If you have a chromebook or iPad / tablet, you will need to use [posit.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/).**\n\n2.  **RStudio** is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) - basically a ‚Äúhome‚Äù for R to live in, with rooms and this program is not 100% necessary, but makes it a little easier to navigate R. Note that you will need to install R first in order for RStudio to work.\n\n**Having trouble getting these programs to work?**\n\n1.  **Here‚Äôs [one YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Qu7Jg1Jw5A)** someone made to show you how to download and install.\n\n2.  **Try [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud)**. This is a web-based version of RStudio, and has a free option but limits you to 15-hours of work a month. There‚Äôs a paid option for \\$5/month that you can use; former students pointed out that you can always create a new ‚Äúfree‚Äù account if you run over the 15-hour limit.\n\n3.  **Post on our class Discord / go to section / office hours!** The professor, other students, or your TA can help get everything working properly.\n\n### Navigating R\n\nWatch the two videos below for a quick introduction to R - the program we will be using to analyze data.\n\n#### VIDEO : Navigating R\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/TDt8x4ASZoc title = \"Intro to R the program\">}}\n\n-   what R looks like when you open it\n\n-   basic math in the¬†**console**\n\n-   indexing and output\n\n#### VIDEO : Navigating RStudio\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/on5oPls94oU title = \"Intro to RStudio the program\">}}\n\n-   what RStudio/Posit looks like; navigating the program\n\n-   basic math in the console\n\n-   the¬†**source file**¬†(makes life easier and saves your work!)\n\n# Quiz 1\n\nUse this week‚Äôs readings and videos to answer the questions below. Make sure to reference the video on getting started on Quiz 1 (above) before starting this quiz. You will have time to work on this in your discussion section (see agenda above) before lecture if you get stuck on something in R. **Note that Quizzes are open-note and untimed and allow for multiple attempts (highest grade is recorded).**\n\n1.
