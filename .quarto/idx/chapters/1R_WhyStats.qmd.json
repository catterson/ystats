{"title":"Why Statistics (Research Methods, and R)?","markdown":{"headingText":"Why Statistics (Research Methods, and R)?","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nIn this week’s reading, you’ll learn why psychology students like you are required to take this course - a statistics class, a research methods class, and an R programming class.\n\n## To-Do List :\n\n1.  Read this document and watch the four (4) videos.\n2.  Take the on-boarding survey and save the code you get at the end for the quiz.\n3.  Submit the code to the quiz on bCourses.\n\n## Why Statistics in Psychology?\n\nAs y’all know, this class is a requirement for students who want to be psychology majors. This is exciting for me (your professor), and probably some students too. However, over the years I have learned this can be frustrating and stressful for students who wonder *why-the-flip* they are required to take a math class when all they just want to learn about people (or other non-human animals), you know!??!\n\nI agree that people (or non-human animals) are interesting. And we all have this interest in people (or non-human animals) because we are complex[^1r_whystats-1]. While people are similar in many ways, we also differ in radical ways; from superficial features like age and race, to more complex ways like our personality or emotions, to highly specific behaviors such as whether all students in the class are reading these words or not, or how bored or excited (or any emotional experience) students are while reading these words…y’all get the idea.\n\n[^1r_whystats-1]:  One of the reasons I love teaching in the Bay Area is y’all are hella complex.\n\nIndividuals differ in terms of every facet of life, and statistics and research methods are the tools that psychologists use to try and study those differences.\n\n### Statistics as a Language\n\n|  |  |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| ![](images/stat_cat_talk_right.png){width=\"50\"} | Statistics is a language that scientists use to describe this complexity. While psychology uses this language to better understand differences in people (or non-human animals), other scientific disciplines focus on their own domains; physicists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in matter and energy, chemists seek to understand differences (and similarities) in elements and compounds, botanists seek to understand differences in plants, and economists seek to understand money. |\n\n-   **Vocabulary.** Statistics has specific definitions for specific ideas, such as “between-person” and “within-person variation” (as described above). Statistics terms like “standard deviation” are also just vocabulary (in this case an equation to define a type of variation). Some of these vocabulary words are easier to understand and remember than others, and like all languages, sometimes people disagree on the definition, and sometimes misuse these words.\n\n-   **Grammar and Syntax.** The way we organize words also matters when learning languages. Saying “the professor graded the students“ has a very different meaning than “the students graded the professor”, even though these share the exact same words. Statistics (and research methods) also requires precision in the way we organize the ideas, terms, and processes. We’ll learn more about this as we discuss the scientific method (a highly structured and organized approach to doing research), but also as we learn how to navigate doing data analysis.\n\n-   **Cultural Immersion.** A good language class will also help students to understand the ways that the language is connected to people, places, and history (and usually food, though I’m not sure if there’s cultural food norms abouts statistics or research methods). In this class, we’ll think about the ways we can immerse ourselves in the culture of statistics and research methods, from the cultural practices that inform which methods or tools to use, to the ways that the culture of statistics and research might needlessly create barriers for certain types of people or studies.\n\n-   **Practice and Past Experiences.** And yes, in order to gain fluency in a language, you need to practice! Attendance and regular engagement with this class will ensure that you are able to get the practice that you need. It’s also good to note that people differ in terms of their past experiences with computers and math, and are bringing those experiences (for better or worse) with them into this class.\n\n###
