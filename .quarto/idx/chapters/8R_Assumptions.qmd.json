And guess what? When the IV has more than three levels, we can use the same linear model. Hooray! The only difference is now you have multiple levels that differ from the intercept (or “reference group”).\n\nLet's mix it up, and see if some good ol' fashioned YOUTUBE VIDEOS OF A DISEMBODIED VOICE can explain this.\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nlibrary(car)\nlibrary(gplots)\n\npresto <- Prestige\n```\n\n### **Video 1 : Defining the Model with the lm() function**\n\n-   [**here’s a link to R Script (as used in the video)**](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/zftlvmxn81onija9awafk/7_3LevelModelQuiz7.R?rlkey=5qxhanq64lbvmtya7du6ubypf&dl=0)\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/pTnWxUq9opE >}}\n\n```{r}\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nhist(presto$prestige)\nplot(presto$type)\n\nmod <- lm(prestige ~ type, data = presto)\nmod\n```\n\n### **Video 2 : Interpreting the Model**\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/d2p8Aj_Xcd4 >}}\n\n#### **The Linear Model Equation:**\n\n```{r}\ncoef(mod)\n```\n\n#### **Using the Equation and Dummy Coding to Generate Predicted Values**\n\n+----------+-----------------+------------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n|          | (the intercept) | X1         | X2       | Calculations            | Predicted Value |\n|          |                 |            |          |                         |                 |\n|          | **35.5**        | (typeprof) | (typewc) |                         |                 |\n|          |                 |            |          |                         |                 |\n|          |                 | **32.3**   | **6.7**  |                         |                 |\n+----------+-----------------+------------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n| bc       | 1               | 0          | 0        | 35.5 + 32.3\\*0 + 6.7\\*0 | = 35.5          |\n+----------+-----------------+------------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n| prof     | 1               | 1          | 0        | 35.5 + 32.3\\*1 + 6.7\\*0 | = 67.8          |\n+----------+-----------------+------------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n| wc       | 1               | 0          | 1        | 35.5 + 32.3\\*0 + 6.7\\*1 | = 42.2          |\n+----------+-----------------+------------+----------+-------------------------+-----------------+\n\n#### **Yes, Professor, A Picture is Worth....1000 Words.**\n\n```{r}\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(presto$prestige, col = presto$type, pch = 19)\nabline(h = coef(mod)[1] + coef(mod)[2], col = 'red', lwd = 5)\nabline(h = coef(mod)[1] + coef(mod)[3], col = 'green', lwd = 5)\nabline(h = coef(mod)[1], col = 'black', lwd = 5) # blue collar\n\nplotmeans(prestige ~ type, data = presto, connect = FALSE)\n```\n\n### **Video 3 : Releveling the Variable**\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/dXtLevWv4WU >}}\n\n```{r}\npresto$typeR <- relevel(presto$type, ref = \"prof\")\nmod2 <- lm(prestige ~ typeR, data = presto)\nplotmeans(prestige ~ typeR, data = presto, connect = FALSE)\ncoef(mod2)\n```\n\n### **Video 4 :** $R^2$ **for a Categorical Model**\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/qebJ3AH6r3I>}}\n\n```{r}\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(presto$prestige, main = \"The Mean as Our Prediction\")\nabline(h = mean(presto$prestige), )\n\nplot(presto$prestige, col = presto$type, pch = 19, main = \"The Model (Job Type) As Our Prediction\")\nabline(h = coef(mod)[1] + coef(mod)[2], col = 'red', lwd = 5)\nabline(h = coef(mod)[1] + coef(mod)[3], col = 'green', lwd = 5)\nabline(h = coef(mod)[1], col = 'black', lwd = 5) # blue collar\n```\n\n## [**CHECK-IN TO ASSESS YOUR UNDERSTANDING HERE**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyhL8OaHrdnmFXc36O6czzfkK1h85ka-XqIV9hWrWjwv5I-A/viewform?usp=sf_link) **\\[no r required\\]**\n\n## Part 2 : Experimental Methods\n\nLast chapter, we learned the “four reasons” why you might find a “pattern in the data” (another way of saying why “correlation does not equal causation”.

Hah hah.\n\n**Here’s a [supplemental chapter on experiments](https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/psychmethods4e/part/experimental-research/) that reviews some key terms you should be familiar with :** experimental manipulation; extraneous variables as “noise”; random assignment; placebo effects; external validity; construct validity; experimenter expectancy effects.\n\n### The Definition of Causality\n\n1.  The cause and effect are contiguous in space and time.\n2.  The cause must be prior to the effect. (no reverse causation)\n3.  There must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect. (“Tis chiefly this quality, that constitutes the relation.”) (no random chance)\n4.  The same cause always produces the same effect, and the same effect never arises but from the same cause. (not \"just\" some third variable) [^1]\n\n[^1] but remember, life is complex and there are often multiple causes of human behavior!\n\n### The Google Experiment\n\nWhen I worked at Google as an intern for one summer[^8r_assumptions-2], corporate PR told a story about their \"data driven approach\", where no decision was left to mere chance. Even something as simple as the color font they used could be the focus of an analytic research question.\n\n[^8r_assumptions-2]: well-fed; gratuitously paid; soul-drained. I was in their \"People Operations\" (/HR) department, helping them set up longitudinal surveys and do various other research projects on compensation, appreciation, and diversity that helped feed the corporate beast.\n\n+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+\n| **Google Homepage : Before Experiments** | **Google Homepage : After Experiments** |\n+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+\n| ![](images/7_goog.png)                   | ![](images/7_goog2.png)                 |\n+------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------+\n\nWatch the video below.

Google was changing its own website. an example of low external validity would be printing out a sheet with different shades of blue that users “click” on with their finger.\n\n-   **ethics :** WOULD
