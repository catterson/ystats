## The Professor.

Hi again! I'm very much looking forward to the semester, and hope you are too!

Below is a short video so you can see what I look and sound like.

## Goals of the Course

This class is really three classes in one semester - a **research methods class** where you will learn how psychologists collect data in order to answer questions about people (or non-human animals), a **programming** class where you will learn how to use R to work with these data, and a **statistics class** where you will learn how and why psychologists analyze this data to answer their questions.

There are two major assignments in the class that represent the kinds of authentic skills you might need as a psychological researcher:

1.  **The R Exam.** I'll give you a dataset, and you'll use your knowledge of statistics, R, and research methods to answer questions about the dataset.

2.  **The Final Project.** You will identify a resarch question that you care about, and then design a study, collect data, analyze the data to answer this question (and write up everything as a scientific research paper.) Wow!

We will talk much more about these assignments throughout the semester, and you will be well prepared for them if you follow along with the readings, quizzes, and homework assignments each week.

## Course Structure

This semester, we'll be taking a **flipped classroom** approach to learning the statistics, research methods, and programming required of modern psychology researchers.

1.  **Before lecture** you'll read and watch some videos to be introduced to the content that we will then cover more deeply in lecture. You'll also take a short quiz (no time limit, open-note, and you can take as many times as you'd like) that will encourage you to do the readings, and let me know what topics are still confusing to students.

2.  **During lecture** we will start with a review of concepts you learned from the pre-readings, go over any common questions that students still have, and then use the remaining time to practice and discussing the skills and concepts. We will work on the homework assignment together

3.  **After lecture** you'll complete any homework that we didn't finish in class, and then read for the next week's lecture.

The flipped classroom approach requires y'all to do the readings and watch the videos before class, and requires me to write text and record videos that are engaging and helpful for the students in the class.

## Course Syllabus.

Take a look at our course syllabus - linked above (and also on bCourses). We will chat a little about course policies on the first day.

Also, please take a moment to join our class Discord if you haven't already (the link to join is on bCourses, and in first the announcement I sent) - it's a great space to build community, and ask (and help answer) questions about the class or why R isn't working.

## Getting Started.

Before our first class, please read Chapter 1 (Why Statistics?) By clicking the right arrow below, or clicking on this chapter in the Table of Contents. Yeah!
