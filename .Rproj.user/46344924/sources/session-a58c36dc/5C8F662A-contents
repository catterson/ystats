# Preface {.unnumbered}

Hello! This book - Why Statistics? - was written to support students' learning of the statistics, research methods, and R programming skills that are required of modern psychology researchers.

Whew!

I've learned over the years that students approach statistics with a variety of emotions - many of them negative. For what it's worth, I have been happy to see most students thrive in the class, and will do my best to support y'all and make this class (and book) a positive learning experience^TM^.
